# BCO

The Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO) is a long-term cloud observatory on the windward tip of the island of Barbados {cite:p}`Stevens:2016`. It senses with a range of in-situ and remote sensing instruments the marine trade-winds in the winter time and deeper convection during boreal summer. An overview about the current instrumentation and their daily quicklooks can be found on the [BCO blog](https://barbados.mpimet.mpg.de/).
