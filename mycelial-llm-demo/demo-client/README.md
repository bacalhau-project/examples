# LLM Client for Mycelial/Bacalhau

This application acts as a simple client for the Mycelial/Bacalhau integration demo.  It provides a __very__ simple repo which writes data to a local sqlite database, and then polls for the result in the answers database.  The answers database will have been populated by a Mycelial pipeline that runs:

```
SQLite --> Bacalhau --> SQLite
              \
               --> LLM
```
