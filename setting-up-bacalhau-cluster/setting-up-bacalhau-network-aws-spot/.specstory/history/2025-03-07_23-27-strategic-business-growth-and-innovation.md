<think>The user has provided a comprehensive set of business strategy points covering Market Expansion, Product Innovation, and Operational Excellence. However, there's no direct request for code changes or modifications. This seems to be content that might be included in a strategic plan or roadmap document.

Looking at the open file `deploy_spot.py`, it appears to be a Python script for deploying AWS spot instances for Bacalhau jobs. The user hasn't asked for any specific changes to this file or mentioned anything about it in their query.

Since there's no clear instruction to modify code, I should ask the user for clarification about what they want me to do with this business strategy information
