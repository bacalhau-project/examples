# Error Handling in VPC Deletion Script (2025-03-16 16:58:17)

the line numbers are off in thack tracing so i don't know where this came from 2025-03-16 16:57:39,068 - ERROR - __main__ - delete_vpcs.py:513 - _process_single_region - Failed to delete VPC vpc-0bc80d6af2e646e5f: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'style'

Let me help you track down and fix this error. The error message suggests there's an issue with accessing a 'style' attribute on a tuple object, which is likely happening in the table row handling code.

Let me search through the code to find the relevant sections:

Let me check the `_update_vpc_row` method in more detail:

Read file: delete_vpcs.py

Read file: delete_vpcs.py

I see the issue now. The error is occurring in the `_update_vpc_row` method. The problem is that when updating a row in the table, we're trying to assign a tuple directly to `self.details_table.rows[row_index]`, but the Rich library's Table implementation expects a Row object, not a tuple.

Let me fix this by modifying the `_update_vpc_row` method:

---

```diff
          for row_index, row_text in enumerate(vpc_column._cells):
              if row_text == vpc_id:
-                 # Update the row
-                 self.details_table.rows[row_index] = (
-                     vpc_id,
-                     region,
-                     status,
-                     message,
-                 )
+                 # Update each cell individually
+                 self.details_table.rows[row_index].cells[0].renderable = vpc_id
+                 self.details_table.rows[row_index].cells[1].renderable = region
+                 self.details_table.rows[row_index].cells[2].renderable = status
+                 self.details_table.rows[row_index].cells[3].renderable = message
                  return
  
```

---

I've fixed the issue by changing how we update the table rows. Instead of trying to assign a tuple directly to the row, which was causing the "'tuple' object has no attribute 'style'" error, we now update each cell's renderable content individually using the proper Rich Table API.

The changes:

1. Instead of assigning a tuple to `self.details_table.rows[row_index]`, we now update each cell individually
2. We use the `cells` property of the row and update the `renderable` property of each cell
3. This maintains the proper Rich Table structure and preserves any styling information

This should resolve the error you were seeing. The error occurred because we were trying to replace a Rich Table Row object (which has style information and other attributes) with a simple tuple that doesn't have those attributes.

Try running the script again - it should now work without the "'tuple' object has no attribute 'style'" error. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!

make sure to unmap this - 2025-03-16 17:04:30,274 - ERROR - __main__ - delete_vpcs.py:251 - execute_aws_api - AWS API call failed: An error occurred (DependencyViolation) when calling the DetachInternetGateway operation: Network vpc-0e2c20d6087e12c4e has some mapped public address(es).

I see the issue. When trying to detach the Internet Gateway, we're getting a DependencyViolation error because there are still public IP addresses mapped to resources in the VPC. We need to handle this by releasing any Elastic IP addresses before trying to detach the Internet Gateway.

Let me modify the `delete_vpc_dependencies` method to handle this:

---

```diff

              network_interfaces = (
                  await self.execute_aws_api(
              )["NetworkInterfaces"]
  
+             # Release any Elastic IP addresses
+             for eni in network_interfaces:
+                 if eni.get("Association") and eni["Association"].get("PublicIp"):
+                     # Update status to show we're releasing Elastic IPs
+                     self._update_vpc_row(
+                         vpc_id,

+                                 logger.error(f"Error releasing Elastic IP: {str(e)}")

              for eni in network_interfaces:
                  if eni["Status"] not in ["deleting", "deleted"]:

+                         await self.execute_aws_api(

              # Next, terminate any EC2 instances in the VPC
```

I've made several important changes to handle the dependency violation error:

1. Added code to release Elastic IP addresses:
   - First checks for any network interfaces with associated public IPs
   - Disassociates the Elastic IP from the network interface
   - Releases the Elastic IP allocation
   - Shows progress in the UI during this process

2. Added proper network interface cleanup:
   - Detaches network interfaces (with force=True to ensure it happens)
   - Deletes the network interfaces
   - Added proper error handling for cases where resources might already be deleted

3. Improved the order of operations:
   - Release Elastic IPs first
   - Then detach and delete network interfaces
   - Then proceed with the rest of the cleanup

This should now handle the "DependencyViolation" error you were seeing by properly cleaning up the public IP addresses before attempting to detach the Internet Gateway.

Try running the script again - it should now be able to properly clean up VPCs with mapped public addresses. Let me know if you encounter any other issues!
