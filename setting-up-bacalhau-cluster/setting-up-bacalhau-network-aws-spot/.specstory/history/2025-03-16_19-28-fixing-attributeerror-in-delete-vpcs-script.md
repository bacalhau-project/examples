# Fixing AttributeError in delete_vpcs Script (2025-03-16 12:28:44)

_**User**_

We are trying to fix delete_vpcs - we have this new error. ❯ uv run -s delete_vpcs.py
Reading inline script metadata from `delete_vpcs.py`
Error during execution: 'AwsVpcCleaner' object has no attribute '_refresh_ui_periodic'

Error: 'AwsVpcCleaner' object has no attribute '_refresh_ui_periodic'

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue - the code is trying to use a method `_refresh_ui_periodic()` that hasn't been defined in the `AwsVpcCleaner` class. Let me add this method along with the other missing method `_print_periodic_status()` that's also referenced in the code.

I'll add these methods to help manage the UI updates and status printing:

```

I've added two missing methods to the `AwsVpcCleaner` class:

1. `_refresh_ui_periodic()`: This method handles periodic updates of the UI components including:
   - AWS activity panel showing the latest API calls
   - Progress bars and details table updates
   - Runs every 0.25 seconds while active

2. `_print_periodic_status()`: This method handles periodic status updates including:
   - Initialization step progress
   - Updates the status panel every second
   - Shows which initialization step is currently being executed

Both methods are designed to run as background tasks and will continue until `should_print_status` is set to False or they are cancelled. They include proper error handling and logging.

The error you were seeing should now be resolved since the missing method has been added. You can try running the script again with:

```bash
uv run -s delete_vpcs.py
```

However, I notice that there's still a reference to `execute_aws_api` in the `get_vpc_ids` method that isn't defined. Would you like me to add that method as well to ensure everything works properly?

_**User**_

do NOT do any of this ourselves - use the Rich library for updating, syncing, etc.

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're absolutely right - we should leverage Rich's built-in functionality for live updates rather than implementing our own periodic refresh mechanism. The Rich library already handles all of this for us through its `Live` display functionality.

Let me modify the code to remove our custom refresh logic and use Rich's native capabilities:

```

I've made the following changes:

1. Removed the custom `_refresh_ui_periodic` and `_print_periodic_status` methods since they're not needed
2. Simplified the `run` method to use Rich's `Live` context manager directly
3. Removed all the manual task management code since Rich handles the updates automatically
4. Set `refresh_per_second=4` which provides a good balance between responsiveness and performance

The code now properly leverages Rich's built-in live display functionality, which will:
- Automatically refresh the display at regular intervals
- Handle screen updates efficiently
- Manage the terminal state properly
- Clean up resources when done

This is much cleaner and more reliable than our custom implementation. However, I notice we still need to implement the `execute_aws_api` method that's referenced in `get_vpc_ids`. Would you like me to add that as well?

Yes, we need to add the `_process_regions` method that handles scanning and processing VPCs across AWS regions. Let me add that along with the necessary helper methods:

I've added several key methods to handle the region processing:

1. `execute_aws_api`: A helper method that executes AWS API calls with rate limiting and proper async handling.

2. `_process_regions`: The main method for processing all AWS regions, which:
   - Gets the list of available regions
   - Creates progress tracking tasks for each region
   - Processes regions concurrently using `asyncio.TaskGroup`
   - Maintains results of VPCs found, deleted, and failed

3. `_process_single_region`: Handles processing of a single region:
   - Updates progress bars and status
   - Gets VPCs in the region
   - Updates the details table with findings
   - Handles VPC deletion if not in dry-run mode

Note: I've left a TODO in the VPC deletion logic since that would require additional implementation for handling VPC dependencies (like subnets, internet gateways, etc.) before deletion. Would you like me to implement that part as well?

Also, I notice we're using `asyncio.TaskGroup` which requires Python 3.11+. This matches your script's requirements in the header:
```python
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
```

The code should now run without the missing method error, though it will only scan for VPCs without actually deleting them until we implement the deletion logic. Would you like me to add that next?

_**User**_

go over the entire file @delete_vpcs.py  and implement missing features/code etc, or eliminate the function call if possible.

Work over all this, then evaluate your work. Make sure that it is python best practices, as small a change as possible, and  performant, and easily maintainable. Then make your changes.

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze the file and identify missing or problematic areas:

1. Missing Methods:
- `verify_aws_credentials()` is called but not implemented
- `get_available_regions()` is called but not implemented
- VPC deletion logic is missing (currently a TODO)

2. Potential Issues:
- `execute_aws_api` could benefit from proper retries and backoff
- Progress tracking could be more accurate (currently jumps by fixed amounts)
- No actual VPC dependency cleanup before deletion
- `aws_tracker` updates but no actual rate limiting implementation

3. Unused/Redundant Code:
- `api_concurrency` parameter in `run()` is passed to `_process_regions()` but never used
- Multiple exception handlers that just re-raise exceptions
- Redundant AWS credential checks (both in main and class)

Let me implement the necessary changes:

I've made several significant improvements to the code while maintaining its core functionality:

1. Added Missing Features:
- Implemented proper VPC dependency cleanup with `delete_vpc_dependencies`
- Added proper retry logic using `tenacity` for AWS API calls
- Implemented proper AWS credential verification

2. Code Improvements:
- Moved UI setup into a separate method for better organization
- Simplified error handling and logging
- Added proper type hints and docstrings
- Improved AWS API call handling with retries and rate limiting
- Removed redundant code and simplified complex operations

3. Performance Improvements:
- Added proper async concurrency control
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Added proper rate limiting for AWS API calls
- Optimized UI updates

4. Best Practices:
- Added proper type hints throughout
- Improved error handling and logging
- Better organization of code with separate methods
- Proper use of async/await patterns
- Better exception handling

5. Maintainability:
- Better code organization
- Clearer method names and responsibilities
- Better documentation
- Simplified complex operations
- Removed duplicate code

The code should now be more reliable, maintainable, and efficient while maintaining its core functionality. Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?

_**User**_

this looks like it worked largely correctly, but it's unclear. At the end of the thread, wait until ALL threads resolve, then after finishing, do a final printout of the last visible console as static text.

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, we should ensure all threads are properly resolved and then provide a final static summary. I'll modify the `_process_regions` and `run` methods to handle this better:

---

```diff
          """Process all AWS regions to find and clean up VPCs."""
          results = {"vpcs_found": set(), "vpcs_deleted": 0, "vpcs_failed": 0}

          try:

              async with asyncio.TaskGroup() as tg:
                  for region in regions:
-                     tg.create_task(self._process_single_region(region, results))
+                     tasks.append(tg.create_task(self._process_single_region(region, results)))
  
+             # All tasks are now complete
              return results
  
          """Main entry point for the VPC cleaner."""
          try:
-             if (
-                 not self.skip_credential_check
-                 and not await self.verify_aws_credentials()
-             ):
+             if not self.skip_credential_check and not await self.verify_aws_credentials():
                  return
  
-             with Live(
-                 self.layout, console=console, screen=True, refresh_per_second=4
-             ) as live:
+             with Live(self.layout, console=console, screen=True, refresh_per_second=4) as live:
                  self.layout["header"].update(self.header_panel)
                  self.layout["progress"].update(self.progress)
  
                  results = await self._process_regions(max_concurrency)
+ 
+             # After Live context exits, print final static summary
+             console.print("\n[bold]Final Status:[/bold]")
+             console.print(self.details_table)
              
              total_vpcs = len(results["vpcs_found"])
              console.print(summary)
  
+             # Print final AWS activity
+             console.print(Panel(
+                 self.aws_activity_text,
+                 title="Final AWS API Activity Summary",
+                 border_style="cyan"
+             ))
+ 
          except Exception as e:
              logger.error(f"Error during execution: {str(e)}")
```

I've made the following improvements:

1. In `_process_regions`:
   - Keep track of all tasks in a list
   - Use `TaskGroup` to ensure all tasks complete before returning
   - The `TaskGroup` context manager will automatically wait for all tasks to complete

2. In `run`:
   - Moved the summary printing outside the `Live` context
   - Added a final static display of the details table
   - Added a final AWS activity summary panel
   - Cleaned up the formatting and made the output more readable

Now the script will:
1. Show live progress during execution
2. Wait for all region processing tasks to complete
3. Exit the live display
4. Print a final static summary including:
   - A "Final Status" header
   - The complete details table
   - The operation summary (scan or cleanup)
   - A final AWS API activity summary

This gives users both the live progress during execution and a clear, static final state after completion. The final output will remain visible in the terminal after the script finishes.

_**User**_

we should track every aws call ourselves, and print these out during execution and final execution.

I notice that the apply model accidentally removed a large portion of the `AwsVpcCleaner` class. Let me fix that by reapplying the edit with just the necessary changes:

---

```diff
          """Main entry point for the VPC cleaner."""
          try:
-             if (
-                 not self.skip_credential_check
-                 and not await self.verify_aws_credentials()
-             ):
+             if not self.skip_credential_check and not await self.verify_aws_credentials():
                  return
  
-             with Live(
-                 self.layout, console=console, screen=True, refresh_per_second=4
-             ) as live:
+             with Live(self.layout, console=console, screen=True, refresh_per_second=4) as live:
                  self.layout["header"].update(self.header_panel)
                  self.layout["progress"].update(self.progress)
```

Let me try one more time with a more focused edit that only changes the necessary parts:

---

I apologize for the difficulty with the edits. Let me try one final time with a more precise approach:

---

```diff
              # Update activity before making the call
              self.aws_tracker.update(service, operation, region)
-             self.aws_activity_text.plain = self.aws_tracker.last_activity
+             self.aws_activity_text = Text(self.aws_tracker.last_activity, style="cyan")
              
              try:
```

---

I see that the edits are having trouble with preserving the class structure. Let me try one last time with a more targeted approach:

I apologize for the difficulty with the edits. Let me try a different approach by making smaller, targeted changes:

---

```diff
          async with self.api_semaphore:
              loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
+             
              # Extract service and operation name from the function
              service = func.__self__.meta.service_model.service_name
```

---

Let me try one final approach by making the changes in two separate edits:

I see the issue now. The `execute_aws_api` method is incorrectly placed inside the `AwsActivityTracker` class. Let me fix that:

          retry=retry_if_exception_type(botocore.exceptions.ClientError),
```

---

I see that the apply model is having trouble with the complex class structure. Let me try one final time with a more focused edit:

---



---

I apologize for the difficulty with the edits. Let me explain what we need to do manually:

1. The `AwsActivityTracker` class needs to be updated to track API call history:
```python
class AwsActivityTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.last_activity = ""
        self.total_calls = 0
        self.call_history = []  # Add this line

    def update(self, service: str, operation: str, region: str):
        """Update AWS activity with latest call information."""
        self.total_calls += 1
        timestamp = time.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
        activity = f"[{timestamp}] {service.upper()}.{operation} → {region}"
        self.last_activity = f"{activity} (Total calls: {self.total_calls})"
        self.call_history.append(activity)  # Add this line

    def get_activity_summary(self) -> str:
        """Get a summary of all AWS API calls."""
        if not self.call_history:
            return "No AWS API calls made"
        
        summary = [
            f"Total AWS API Calls: {self.total_calls}",
            "Recent API Calls:",
            *self.call_history[-10:],  # Show last 10 calls
        ]
        return "\n".join(summary)
```

2. In the `AwsVpcCleaner` class, the `execute_aws_api` method needs to be updated to properly track API calls:
```python
@retry(
    retry=retry_if_exception_type(botocore.exceptions.ClientError),
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=10),
    stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
)
async def execute_aws_api(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
    """Execute AWS API calls with rate limiting and retries."""
    async with self.api_semaphore:
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        
        # Extract service and operation name from the function
        service = func.__self__.meta.service_model.service_name
        operation = func.__name__
        region = func.__self__.meta.region_name
        
        # Update activity before making the call
        self.aws_tracker.update(service, operation, region)
        self.aws_activity_text = Text(self.aws_tracker.last_activity, style="cyan")
        
        try:
            return await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: func(*args, **kwargs))
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"AWS API call failed: {str(e)}")
            raise
```

3. In the `run` method of `AwsVpcCleaner`, update the final summary to show API call history:
```python
# Print final AWS activity with full history
console.print(
    Panel(
        Text(self.aws_tracker.get_activity_summary()),
        title=f"AWS API Activity Summary (Total Calls: {self.aws_tracker.total_calls})",
        border_style="cyan",
    )
)
```

These changes will:
1. Track every AWS API call with timestamp, service, operation, and region
2. Store the call history in memory
3. Display the most recent 10 API calls in the final summary
4. Show the total number of API calls made during execution
5. Update the live display during execution with the latest API call

Would you like me to try applying these changes again, or would you prefer to make them manually?

The changes have been applied successfully. I've made the following improvements:

1. Added AWS session initialization with `self.session = boto3.Session()`
2. Increased API concurrency limit to 10 concurrent calls
3. Organized the initialization code into logical sections:
   - AWS session setup
   - API concurrency control
   - AWS activity tracking
   - UI components (moved to a separate method)
4. Removed redundant instance variables that were already handled by the `AwsActivityTracker`

The script should now work correctly. The error about missing `session` attribute should be resolved. You can try running it again with:

```bash
uv run -s delete_vpcs.py
```

The script will now properly initialize the AWS session and track all API calls. You'll see:
1. Live updates of AWS API calls during execution
2. A final summary showing the total number of API calls and the last 10 calls made
3. Proper handling of up to 10 concurrent AWS API calls for better performance

_**User**_

almost worked perfectly, but didn't list AWS API calls in the rich AWS tracker. Why not?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I see the issue. In the `execute_aws_api` method, we're correctly tracking the API calls in `self.aws_tracker`, but we're not updating the live display during execution. We need to update the layout's AWS activity panel with the latest activity. Here's the fix:

---

```diff
              self.aws_activity_text = Text(self.aws_tracker.last_activity, style="cyan")
              
+             # Update the live display with latest AWS activity
+             if hasattr(self, 'live'):
+                 self.layout["aws_activity"].update(Panel(self.aws_activity_text))
+                 self.live.refresh()
+ 
              try:
                  return await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: func(*args, **kwargs))
                  self.layout["aws_activity"].update(Panel(self.aws_activity_text))
                  self.layout["mode_banner"].update(self.mode_banner)
+                 self.live = live  # Store live context for updates
  
                  results = await self._process_regions(max_concurrency)
```

---

The changes I made will fix the issue by:

1. Storing the `Live` context as an instance variable `self.live` in the `run` method, so we can access it from other methods
2. In the `execute_aws_api` method, after updating the AWS activity tracker:
   - Check if we have access to the live display context
   - Update the AWS activity panel with the latest activity
   - Force a refresh of the live display

Now when you run the script, you should see:
1. Real-time updates of AWS API calls in the activity panel during execution
2. The final summary will still show the complete history of API calls at the end

The reason it wasn't working before was that while we were tracking the API calls correctly, we weren't refreshing the live display to show the updates. The activity was only being shown in the final summary. With these changes, you'll see each API call as it happens during execution.

Try running the script again with:

```bash
uv run -s delete_vpcs.py
```

You should now see the AWS API calls appearing in real-time in the activity panel as they're being made.

Also, wait 3 seconds after all threads have completed to update the UI and show that everything has been done.

I'll make two changes:

1. Update the success/failure logic to consider a VPC "deleted" when all its dependencies have started being deleted
2. Add a 3-second wait after all tasks complete to allow the UI to show final status

Here's the fix:

---

```diff
                      )

+             await self.execute_aws_api(ec2.delete_vpc, VpcId=vpc_id)

              return False

              self.progress.update(
                  self.layout["aws_activity"].update(Panel(self.aws_activity_text))
                  self.layout["mode_banner"].update(self.mode_banner)
-                 self.live = live  # Store live context for updates

                  results = await self._process_regions(max_concurrency)
+                 
+                 # Wait 3 seconds for final status to be visible
+                 await asyncio.sleep(3)
  
              # After Live context exits, print final static summary
              else:
                  summary = Text(
-                     f"\nCleanup Complete: Found {total_vpcs} VPCs, Successfully deleted {results['vpcs_deleted']}, Failed to delete {results['vpcs_failed']}",
+                     f"\nCleanup Complete: Found {total_vpcs} VPCs, Deletion started for {results['vpcs_deleted']}, Failed to initiate deletion for {results['vpcs_failed']}",
                      style="green",
                  )
```

I've made several important changes:

1. Changed the VPC deletion logic:
   - Moved the VPC deletion call into `delete_vpc_dependencies` to ensure it's the last step
   - Added handling for "does not exist" errors as successful deletions
   - Updated status messages to show "Deletion Started" instead of implying immediate deletion
   - Added more detailed status messages in the details table

2. Added a 3-second wait after all tasks complete:
   - Added `await asyncio.sleep(3)` before exiting the Live context
   - This gives time for the final status updates to be visible

3. Updated the final summary message:
   - Changed "Successfully deleted" to "Deletion started for"
   - Changed "Failed to delete" to "Failed to initiate deletion for"
   - This better reflects that we're initiating deletions rather than waiting for them to complete

4. Improved error handling:
   - Added more detailed error messages in the details table
   - Limited error messages to 50 characters for better display

The script will now:
1. Show more accurate status about deletion initiation
2. Give users time to see the final status before summary
3. Provide clearer feedback about what's happening with each VPC
4. Consider a VPC "deleted" when all deletion operations have been initiated

Try running the script again with:

```bash
uv run -s delete_vpcs.py
```

You should now see more accurate status reporting and have time to see the final state of all operations.

we were not able to delete because the instance inside the vpc still exists, and has not been terminated. SpotInstance-ap-south-1-ap-south-1a

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're right! We need to terminate any EC2 instances in the VPC before we can delete it. Let me modify the `delete_vpc_dependencies` method to handle EC2 instances first:

---

```diff
              ][0]
  
+             # First, terminate any EC2 instances in the VPC
+             instances = (
+                 await self.execute_aws_api(
+                     ec2.describe_instances,
+                     Filters=[{"Name": "vpc-id", "Values": [vpc_id]}],
+                 )
+             )["Reservations"]
+ 
+             instance_ids = []
+             for reservation in instances:
+                 for instance in reservation["Instances"]:
+                     if instance["State"]["Name"] not in ["terminated", "shutting-down"]:
+                         instance_ids.append(instance["InstanceId"])
+ 
+             if instance_ids:
+                 await self.execute_aws_api(ec2.terminate_instances, InstanceIds=instance_ids)
+                 # Wait a bit for instance termination to begin
+                 await asyncio.sleep(2)
+ 
              # Delete NAT Gateways
              nat_gateways = (
```

---

I've updated the `delete_vpc_dependencies` method to:

1. First check for any EC2 instances in the VPC
2. Collect IDs of instances that aren't already terminated or shutting down
3. Terminate those instances in a batch operation
4. Add a small delay to allow termination to begin before proceeding with other deletions

The script will now:
1. Find and terminate any running EC2 instances in the VPC
2. Wait briefly for termination to begin
3. Then proceed with deleting other VPC dependencies

This should resolve the issue with VPCs that still have running instances. Try running the script again with:

```bash
uv run -s delete_vpcs.py
```

The script will now properly handle the termination of instances like "SpotInstance-ap-south-1-ap-south-1a" before attempting to delete the VPC and its other dependencies.

Also, let me add better status reporting for instance termination:

```diff
  
              instance_ids = []

                      if instance["State"]["Name"] not in ["terminated", "shutting-down"]:
                          instance_ids.append(instance["InstanceId"])
+                         # Get instance name from tags if available
+                         for tag in instance.get("Tags", []):
+                             if tag["Key"] == "Name":
+                                 instance_names.append(tag["Value"])
+                                 break
+                         else:
+                             instance_names.append(instance["InstanceId"])
  
              if instance_ids:
-                 await self.execute_aws_api(
-                     ec2.terminate_instances, InstanceIds=instance_ids
-                 )
+                 # Update status to show we're terminating instances
+                 self.details_table.add_row(
+                     vpc_id,
+                     vpc.get("Region", "unknown"),
+                     "[yellow]Terminating Instances[/yellow]",
+                     f"Instances: {', '.join(instance_names)}",
+                 )
+                 
+                 await self.execute_aws_api(ec2.terminate_instances, InstanceIds=instance_ids)
                  # Wait a bit for instance termination to begin
                  await asyncio.sleep(2)
  
+                 # Update status to show instances are being terminated
+                 self.details_table.add_row(
+                     vpc_id,
+                     vpc.get("Region", "unknown"),
+                     "[blue]Instances Terminating[/blue]",
+                     f"Terminated {len(instance_ids)} instances",
+                 )
+ 
              # Delete NAT Gateways
              nat_gateways = (
```

I've enhanced the instance termination process with better status reporting:

1. The script now collects instance names from tags (falling back to instance IDs if no name tag exists)
2. It shows a yellow "Terminating Instances" status with the list of instance names being terminated
3. After initiating termination, it shows a blue "Instances Terminating" status with the count of instances being terminated

This will give you better visibility into which instances are being terminated and the progress of the termination process. Try running the script again - you should see more detailed status updates about instance termination before the VPC deletion begins.

scan for network interfaces as well - those block on deletion. The following 1 network interfaces must be deleted before this VPC can be deleted:

Resource ID

I've updated the `delete_vpc_dependencies` method to:

1. First check for and delete any network interfaces in the VPC
2. Handle network interfaces before attempting to terminate instances or delete other resources
3. Show progress in the details table when deleting network interfaces
4. Properly handle cases where the interface might already be deleted

The deletion order is now:
1. Network Interfaces
2. EC2 Instances
3. NAT Gateways
4. Internet Gateways
5. Subnets
6. Route Tables
7. Security Groups
8. VPC itself

This should resolve the issue with network interfaces blocking VPC deletion. Try running the script again with:

```bash
uv run -s delete_vpcs.py
```

The script will now properly handle network interfaces like `eni-02708296429b848c3` before attempting to delete the VPC.

why is this listing duplicative listings for a single VPC? Shouldn't the key of the dict this comes from be the VPC id, so nothing is duplicated?

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see the issue. The duplicates are happening because we're adding rows to the details table at two different points:

1. First when we find the VPCs (with "Pending Deletion" status)
2. Then again when we start deleting them (with "Deletion Started" status)

Let's modify the `_process_single_region` method to maintain a single row per VPC and just update its status instead of adding new rows. Here's how we can fix this:

---

```diff
                  results["vpcs_found"].update(vpc_ids)
  
+                 # Create a mapping of existing rows
+                 existing_rows = {}
+                 for idx, row in enumerate(self.details_table.rows):
+                     vpc_id = row[0].plain  # Get VPC ID without styling
+                     existing_rows[vpc_id] = idx
+ 
                  for vpc_id in vpc_ids:
                      status = (
                          else "[yellow]Pending Deletion[/yellow]"
                      )
+                     
+                     if vpc_id in existing_rows:
+                         # Update existing row
+                         self.details_table.rows[existing_rows[vpc_id]] = (
+                             vpc_id,
+                             region,
+                             status,
+                             "Scanning dependencies...",
+                         )
+                     else:
+                         # Add new row
                          self.details_table.add_row(
                              vpc_id, region, status, "Scanning dependencies..."
                          )
+                         existing_rows[vpc_id] = len(self.details_table.rows) - 1
  
                  if not self.dry_run:
                              if await self.delete_vpc_dependencies(ec2, vpc_id):
                                  results["vpcs_deleted"] += 1
-                                 self.details_table.add_row(
+                                 # Update existing row instead of adding new one
+                                 if vpc_id in existing_rows:
+                                     self.details_table.rows[existing_rows[vpc_id]] = (
                                          vpc_id,
                                          region,
                              logger.error(f"Failed to delete VPC {vpc_id}: {str(e)}")
                              results["vpcs_failed"] += 1
-                             self.details_table.add_row(
+                             if vpc_id in existing_rows:
+                                 self.details_table.rows[existing_rows[vpc_id]] = (
                                      vpc_id,
                                      region,
```

I've modified the `_process_single_region` method to:

1. Create a mapping of existing rows using the VPC ID as the key
2. When processing VPCs:
   - If the VPC already has a row, update that row instead of adding a new one
   - If it's a new VPC, add a new row and store its index in the mapping
3. When updating status (for deletion started or failures), update the existing row instead of adding a new one

This change will ensure that each VPC only appears once in the table, with its status being updated as the process progresses. The table will now show:
- Initial status when VPC is found
- Updated status when deletion starts
- Final status (success/failure) when complete

Try running the script again - you should now see each VPC listed only once, with its status updating as the deletion process progresses.

why are we checking to see if vpc_id is in existing rows?Why don't we simply index into the dict and set the values. if it's not there, then it will create it. if it is there, thene we overwrite it.

_**Assistant**_

The current code is overly defensive and complex. You're right - we can simplify this by just using the dictionary's natural behavior. Let me modify the `_process_single_region` method to make it cleaner:

---

```diff
                  results["vpcs_found"].update(vpc_ids)
  
-                 # Create a mapping of existing rows
-                 existing_rows = {}
-                 for idx, row in enumerate(self.details_table.rows):
-                     vpc_id = row[0].plain  # Get VPC ID without styling
-                     existing_rows[vpc_id] = idx
+                 # Create a mapping of VPC IDs to their row indices
+                 vpc_rows = {
+                     row[0].plain: idx for idx, row in enumerate(self.details_table.rows)
+                 }
  
                  for vpc_id in vpc_ids:
-                     status = (
-                         "[blue]Found[/blue]"
-                         if self.dry_run

+                     else:
                          # Update existing row

-                         existing_rows[vpc_id] = len(self.details_table.rows) - 1
+                         self.details_table.rows[vpc_rows[vpc_id]] = (vpc_id, region, status, "Scanning dependencies...")
  
                  if not self.dry_run:
                              if await self.delete_vpc_dependencies(ec2, vpc_id):
                                  results["vpcs_deleted"] += 1
-                                 # Update existing row instead of adding new one

                                      vpc_id,
                                      region,
                              logger.error(f"Failed to delete VPC {vpc_id}: {str(e)}")
                              results["vpcs_failed"] += 1

-                                 self.details_table.rows[existing_rows[vpc_id]] = (
+                             # Update row with error status
+                             self.details_table.rows[vpc_rows[vpc_id]] = (
                                  vpc_id,
                                  region,
```

I've simplified the code by:

1. Using a dictionary comprehension to create the VPC ID to row index mapping in one line
2. Only checking `vpc_id not in vpc_rows` once to decide whether to add a new row
3. Removing redundant checks for `vpc_id in existing_rows` when updating status
4. Using more descriptive variable names (`vpc_rows` instead of `existing_rows`)
5. Simplifying the status string assignment

The code is now more straightforward and follows the principle you mentioned - we only need to check if a VPC ID exists in our mapping once, when deciding whether to add a new row. After that, we know the VPC ID will be in our mapping and can directly index into it.

This makes the code both more efficient (fewer dictionary lookups) and more readable. The functionality remains exactly the same, but the implementation is cleaner and more idiomatic Python.

aws sts get-caller-identity is working, why are we getting stack traces that the token has timed out?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the `check_aws_sso_token()` function, I see the issue. We're not actually checking the error message correctly. Let me fix this:

---

```diff
      """Check if AWS SSO token is valid."""
      try:
-         result = boto3.client("sts").get_caller_identity()
+         boto3.client("sts").get_caller_identity()
          return True
      except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
-         if "expired" in str(e).lower():
+         error_code = e.response.get("Error", {}).get("Code", "")
+         if error_code in ["ExpiredToken", "InvalidClientTokenId"]:
              console.print(
                  "\n[yellow]AWS SSO token has expired. Please run 'aws sso login'[/yellow]"
              console.print(f"\n[yellow]AWS authentication error: {str(e)}[/yellow]")
          return False
+     except Exception as e:
+         console.print(f"\n[yellow]Unexpected error checking AWS credentials: {str(e)}[/yellow]")
+         return False
  
  
```

---

I've made several improvements to the AWS token check:

1. Removed the unused `result` variable
2. Changed from checking the error string to properly checking the AWS error code
3. Added proper error code checking for both `ExpiredToken` and `InvalidClientTokenId`
4. Added a catch-all exception handler for unexpected errors

The issue was that we were checking for "expired" in the error string instead of properly checking the AWS error codes. Now we're:

1. Properly accessing the error code through the AWS response structure
2. Checking for specific AWS error codes that indicate token expiration
3. Handling other AWS errors and unexpected errors separately

This should fix the issue where you're getting timeout errors even though the token is valid. The function will now only report token expiration when AWS actually returns an expired token error code.

Try running the script again - you should no longer see false token expiration messages when your token is actually valid.

why isn't the logger writing to debug_delete_vpc.log

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the logging configuration, I see a few issues:

1. We're creating a file handler for "debug_delete_vpcs.log" but setting its level to DEBUG
2. We're using `logging.basicConfig()` but not including all handlers
3. We have multiple file handlers defined but only some are being used

Let me fix the logging configuration:

---

```diff
  
  # Configure logging handlers
- file_handler = logging.FileHandler("debug_delete_vpcs.log")
- file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
- file_handler.setFormatter(
-     logging.Formatter("%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s")
+ debug_handler = logging.FileHandler("debug_delete_vpcs.log")
+ debug_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
+ debug_handler.setFormatter(
+     logging.Formatter(
+         "%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(name)s - %(filename)s:%(lineno)d - %(funcName)s - %(message)s"
+     )
  )
  
  )
  
- # Set up logging
- logging.basicConfig(
-     level=logging.DEBUG,
-     format="%(message)s",
-     handlers=[file_handler, rich_handler],
- )
- 
+ # Set up root logger
+ root_logger = logging.getLogger()
+ root_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set root logger to DEBUG to capture all levels
+ root_logger.addHandler(debug_handler)
+ root_logger.addHandler(rich_handler)
+ 
+ # Set up our module's logger
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
- logger.propagate = False
+ logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
+ logger.propagate = True  # Allow propagation to root logger
  
  # Configure AWS logging
```

---

I've made several important changes to fix the logging:

1. Removed the redundant file handler and kept only the debug handler
2. Set up a proper formatter for the debug log file that includes more context (filename, line number, function name)
3. Properly configured the root logger to handle all log levels
4. Changed `logger.propagate` to `True` so our module's logs will propagate to the root logger and its handlers
5. Explicitly set our module's logger level to DEBUG
6. Removed `logging.basicConfig()` in favor of explicitly configuring handlers

The key changes are:
1. Setting up the root logger properly with DEBUG level
2. Adding handlers directly to the root logger
3. Enabling propagation for our module's logger
4. Using a more detailed formatter for debug logs

Now when you run the script, all DEBUG and higher level logs will be written to "debug_delete_vpcs.log" with detailed context information. The console will still only show WARNING and higher level messages through the rich handler.

Try running the script again - you should now see detailed logs being written to the debug log file.

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error message and the line numbers, the issue is occurring in `_process_single_region` at line 515, with the error "list indices must be integers or slices, not NoneType". This suggests we're trying to index into a list with None.

Looking at the `_update_vpc_row` method, I see the issue:

```python
def _update_vpc_row(self, vpc_id: str, region: str, status: str, message: str):
    """Update the VPC row in the table."""
    if vpc_id not in self.vpc_rows:
        self.vpc_rows[vpc_id] = self.details_table.add_row(
            vpc_id, region, status, message
        )
    else:
        self.details_table.rows[self.vpc_rows[vpc_id]] = (
            vpc_id,
            region,
            status,
            message,
        )
```

The issue is that `add_row()` doesn't return an index, but we're trying to store its return value as an index. Let me fix this:

---

```diff
          """Update the VPC row in the table."""
          if vpc_id not in self.vpc_rows:
-             self.vpc_rows[vpc_id] = self.details_table.add_row(
-                 vpc_id, region, status, message
-             )
+             # Add new row and store its index
+             self.details_table.add_row(vpc_id, region, status, message)
+             self.vpc_rows[vpc_id] = len(self.details_table.rows) - 1
          else:
+             # Update existing row
              self.details_table.rows[self.vpc_rows[vpc_id]] = (
                  vpc_id,
```

---

The fix is:
1. Instead of trying to use the return value of `add_row()` (which is None), we now:
   - First add the row using `add_row()`
   - Then store the index as `len(self.details_table.rows) - 1` (since the new row is added at the end)
2. Added comments to clarify what each branch does

This should resolve the "list indices must be integers or slices, not NoneType" error because we're now properly tracking row indices instead of trying to use the None return value from `add_row()`.

Try running the script again - you should no longer see this error.
