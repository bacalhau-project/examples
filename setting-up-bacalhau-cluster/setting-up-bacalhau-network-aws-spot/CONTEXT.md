# AWS Spot Cluster for Bacalhau - Project Context

## Current Work Summary

We've been refactoring the Python application that deploys Bacalhau clusters on AWS Spot instances. The original code had issues with silent failures and premature exits without error messages. Our latest work has focused on fixing architecture compatibility between instance types and AMIs to prevent deployment failures.

## What We Did
1. Analyzed the original `deploy_spot.py` file to identify issues causing silent failures:
   - Poor error handling causing silent failures
   - Tasks created but not properly awaited
   - Inadequate timeout handling
   - Early exit logic without proper error reporting

2. Refactored the code into a modular package structure (`bacalhau_spot`):
   - Created a main CLI entry point (`bacalhau_spot_cli.py`)
   - Implemented a robust main module (`bacalhau_spot/main.py`)
   - Built specialized modules for AWS operations, UI management, and spot instance creation
   - Added proper error handling with custom error types
   - Implemented comprehensive state management
   - Fixed timeout issues in AWS API calls

3. Key improvements:
   - Added robust error handling and reporting
   - Implemented clear separation of concerns
   - Fixed issues with asyncio tasks not being properly awaited
   - Added proper timeout handling for AWS operations
   - Improved UI rendering and state tracking

## Previous Work
1. **Error Handling & Reporting** - Implemented comprehensive error detection for AWS credentials and capacity issues with detailed feedback
2. **Resource Tagging System** - Added user-configurable resource naming and tagging for better management
3. **AWS Resource Cleanup** - Created a "nuke" command to delete all tagged resources with safety confirmations

## Key Issues Addressed
1. **Rich Terminal Exit Problem** - Fixed premature termination of the Rich UI display by removing SSH/Bacalhau service waiting
2. **Spot Instance Tracking** - Fixed tracking of spot request fulfillment across all regions
3. **SSH Authentication** - Added support for private SSH key authentication via `private_ssh_key_path` in the config
4. **Instance Deletion** - Improved deletion process with comprehensive resource cleanup
5. **AWS Token Validation** - Added AWS credentials check at the start of the script to verify the SSO token is valid
6. **Resource Management** - Implemented consistent tagging and prefixing for all created resources
7. **Architecture Compatibility** - Fixed issues with instance type and AMI architecture mismatches

## Latest Work (3/5/2025)
We've enhanced the Bacalhau AWS Spot Cluster setup to properly handle architecture compatibility between instance types and AMIs:

1. **AMI Architecture Support:**
   - Modified `get_ubuntu_amis.py` to fetch both x86_64 and arm64 AMIs
   - Added JSON output format (`ubuntu_amis.json`) for programmatic use

2. **Configuration Management:**
   - Enhanced `update_config_with_regions.py` to store architecture information
   - Improved config format to explicitly track architecture for each region

3. **Architecture Validation:**
   - Added upfront architecture compatibility checks in `deploy_spot.py` 
   - Created a new validation script `verify_config_architecture.py`
   - Implemented instance type detection for ARM families (a1, t4g, c6g, m6g, r6g)

## Commands

```bash
# Fetch AMIs for both architectures 
uv run -s util/get_ubuntu_amis.py

# Update config with available regions and AMIs
uv run -s util/update_config_with_regions.py

```

## Next Steps

### For Architecture Enhancement
1. Test the architecture compatibility features with real AWS credentials
2. Verify that ARM instances work correctly with ARM AMIs
3. Check that x86 instances work correctly with x86 AMIs 
4. Create test configurations with different machine types to validate all edge cases
5. Update documentation with architecture compatibility information

### General Improvements
1. Add proper command-line documentation
2. Write unit tests for the new modules
3. Consider adding input validation and more user-friendly error messages
4. Add proper resource cleanup procedures to prevent AWS resource leaks
5. Testing the nuke functionality thoroughly across different AWS environments
6. Adding more resource types to the nuke feature (if any are identified as missing)
7. Implementing cost tracking/estimation for spot instances
8. Adding a full-cluster status command for health monitoring

The refactored codebase is now more maintainable, has better error visibility, and should no longer silently fail when encountering AWS API issues, timeouts, or architecture mismatches.
