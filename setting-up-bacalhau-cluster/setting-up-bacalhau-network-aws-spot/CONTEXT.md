# AWS Spot Cluster for Bacalhau - Project Context

## Current Work Summary

We've been enhancing the AWS spot instance deployment tool for Bacalhau clusters, focusing on several major improvements:

1. **Error Handling & Reporting** - Implemented comprehensive error detection for AWS credentials and capacity issues with detailed feedback
2. **Resource Tagging System** - Added user-configurable resource naming and tagging for better management
3. **AWS Resource Cleanup** - Created a "nuke" command to delete all tagged resources with safety confirmations

## Key Issues Addressed

1. **Rich Terminal Exit Problem** - Fixed premature termination of the Rich UI display by removing SSH/Bacalhau service waiting
2. **Spot Instance Tracking** - Fixed tracking of spot request fulfillment across all regions
3. **SSH Authentication** - Added support for private SSH key authentication via `private_ssh_key_path` in the config
4. **Instance Deletion** - Improved deletion process with comprehensive resource cleanup
5. **AWS Token Validation** - Added AWS credentials check at the start of the script to verify the SSO token is valid
6. **Resource Management** - Implemented consistent tagging and prefixing for all created resources

## Key Files Modified

- `/deploy_spot.py` - Main deployment script with core functionality, added tagging and nuke functionality
- `/util/config.py` - Added private key path support
- `/util/scripts_provider.py` - Fixed SSH key handling
- `/instance/cloud-init/init-vm-template.yml` - Corrected SSH key setup

## Implementation Details

1. Added resource tagging system:
   ```python
   FILTER_TAG_NAME = "bacalhau-cluster"
   FILTER_TAG_VALUE = "bacalhau-aws-spot"
   CREATOR_VALUE = "bacalhau-aws-spot-script"
   RESOURCE_PREFIX = "bacalhau-"
   VPC_NAME = "bacalhau-vpc"
   ```

2. Implemented interactive tag configuration:
   ```python
   def configure_tags_and_names():
       # Interactive system to configure resource tags and naming
   ```

3. Added comprehensive AWS cleanup:
   ```python
   async def nuke_resources(regions, force=False):
       # Delete all tagged AWS resources across regions
       # with confirmation dialog and detailed reporting
   ```

4. Added improved error handling and reporting for create/destroy operations

## Commands

```bash
# Create new spot instances
uv run -s deploy_spot.py create

# List existing spot instances
uv run -s deploy_spot.py list

# Destroy spot instances
uv run -s deploy_spot.py destroy

# Delete all tagged AWS resources
uv run -s deploy_spot.py nuke [--force]
```

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements:
- Testing the nuke functionality thoroughly across different AWS environments
- Adding more resource types to the nuke feature (if any are identified as missing)
- Implementing cost tracking/estimation for spot instances
- Adding a full-cluster status command for health monitoring
