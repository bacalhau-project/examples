# Default to Hardcoding

Prefer hardcoding values, constants, and configurations directly in the code.
Introduce flexibility or configurability (e.g., environment variables, configuration files, command-line arguments) only when there is an explicit and clear requirement for it.
Clearly document the reason for any introduced flexibility. This helps prevent over-engineering and keeps the codebase simpler by default.
