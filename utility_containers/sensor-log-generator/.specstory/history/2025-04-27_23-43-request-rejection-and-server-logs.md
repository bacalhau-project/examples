# Request Rejection and Server Logs (2025-04-27 16:43:05)

_**User**_

if something doesn't match exactly with what we are looking for, then reject it - we don't need a warning.

Okay, I understand you want to reject items that don't match exactly instead of just issuing a warning.

However, the log messages you provided seem to originate from a "Monitor server" and mention HTTP request issues (like `Bad HTTP/0.9 request type`). This doesn't seem directly related to the `src/database.py` file currently open, which primarily handles SQLite database operations and syncing data via HTTP requests *from* this client.

Could you please clarify:

1.  What specific "something" are you referring to that needs to be checked for an exact match?
2.  Where in the code should this check and rejection logic be implemented? Is it within `src/database.py`, or perhaps in the "Monitor server" code you mentioned in the logs?

this is for the monitoring server @monitor.py

Okay, looking at `src/monitor.py`, it seems the `MonitoringRequestHandler` class has already been modified to achieve the behavior you're describing.

Specifically:

1.  `log_error`: This method is overridden to simply `pass`. This prevents the server from logging errors related to request handling, such as the `code 400` messages you saw.
2.  `handle_one_request`: This method is overridden with a `try...except` block that catches any exception during the initial request parsing and handling. If an error occurs (like a malformed request), the exception is caught silently, and the connection is closed without logging.
3.  `log_message`: This method is overridden to only log *successful* requests (status codes 200-299) using `logging.info`. It explicitly avoids logging requests with error status codes like 400.

Based on this code, malformed or unexpected requests should already be silently ignored ("rejected") without generating log warnings or errors like the ones you provided.

Perhaps the log messages you shared were from before these changes were implemented? The current code seems to align with your requirement.
