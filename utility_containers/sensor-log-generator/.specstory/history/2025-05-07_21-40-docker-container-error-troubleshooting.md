The error `OCI runtime create failed: ... exec: "/.venv/bin/python": stat /.venv/bin/python: no such file or directory` indicates that the Python interpreter expected by your `ENTRYPOINT` cannot be found in the final Docker image.

This usually happens in multi-stage Docker builds when the virtual environment (`/.venv`) is created in a builder stage, and its Python interpreter (`/.venv/bin/python`) is a symlink to a Python installation that exists in the builder but isn't copied to the final, minimal stage.

Here's a breakdown of the likely issues in your `Dockerfile` and how to fix them:

1.  **`ENV UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1`**: This environment variable in your builder stage likely forces `uv` to use the system's Python (Python 3.11 from `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm-slim`) for creating the virtual environment, even though you specify `--python 3.12` in `uv venv`. If `/.venv/bin/python` then becomes a symlink to the builder's system Python (e.g., `/usr/bin/python3.11`), this link will be broken in the final Chainguard image if that exact path doesn't exist or points to a different Python version.

2.  **`uv`-installed Python**: If `UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1` were not set (or if `uv` ignored it and proceeded to satisfy `--python 3.12`), `uv` would download and install Python 3.12 into a cache directory (typically `/root/.pythons` when running as root in Docker). The `/.venv/bin/python` would then symlink to this cached interpreter. If this cache directory isn't copied to the final stage, the symlink breaks.

3.  **`uv run -s main.py`**: The `-s` flag in `uv run -s main.py` is likely incorrect. For `uv run`, `-s` or `--system-python` expects a path to a Python interpreter, not a script name. If `main.py` is the script to run (possibly to install its dependencies into the venv), it should probably be `uv run main.py`. While this might not be the primary cause of the `ENTRYPOINT` error, it's a potential issue in your build process.

**Proposed Solution:**

To fix this, we'll modify the `Dockerfile` to:
1.  Remove `ENV UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1` to allow `uv` to properly provision Python 3.12.
2.  Copy the `uv`-installed Python interpreters from the builder stage's cache (assumed to be `/root/.pythons`) to the final stage. This ensures that any symlinks in `/.venv/bin/` pointing to these interpreters remain valid.
3.  (Optionally, but recommended) Correct the `uv run -s main.py` command, though I will focus on the primary `ENTRYPOINT` issue for now.

I'll apply the necessary changes to your `Dockerfile`.

+ # Symlinks in /.venv/bin/python should now point to a valid interpreter in /root/.pythons
  COPY --from=builder /.venv /.venv
  
```

The `Dockerfile` has been updated. I've removed `ENV UV_SYSTEM_PYTHON=1` and added a `COPY` instruction to bring the `uv`-managed Python installations (expected in `/root/.pythons`) into the final image stage before copying the virtual environment itself.

This should resolve the "no such file or directory" error for `/.venv/bin/python`.

Please try building and running your Docker image again with this updated `Dockerfile`.

Regarding the `docker debug` error (`Error: chown ... no such file or directory`), this seems unrelated to the main container execution problem and might be an issue with the `docker debug` tool's environment or how it interacts with `uv`'s cache within its temporary file system. The primary focus here was to fix the container's runtime error.

Okay, the error `"/root/.pythons": not found` means that the path we tried to copy from the builder stage doesn't exist. It seems my previous assumption for `uv`'s Python installation directory (`/root/.pythons`) was incorrect.

Based on `uv`'s documentation, when it needs to install a Python version (like 3.12 in your case if it's not already in a usable form in the base builder image), it typically places it in `~/.cache/uv/pythons`. Since the Docker build runs as root, this path becomes `/root/.cache/uv/pythons`.

The user diff shows you've already changed the line to `COPY --from=builder /root/.python /root/.python`. This path is also likely not the correct cache location.

I'll propose an edit to correct this `COPY` path to `/root/.cache/uv/pythons`.

Additionally, I noticed a persistent issue in your builder stage:
`RUN ... && uv run -s main.py --exit`
The `-s` flag for `uv run` is used to specify a *Python interpreter*, not a script. Using `-s main.py` tells `uv` to try to use `main.py` as if it were a Python executable, which is incorrect and will likely lead to errors or unexpected behavior during the build of the venv or dependency installation. It should probably be `uv run main.py --exit`.

I'll include a fix for this as well.

Here's the proposed change:
1.  Correct the `uv run -s main.py` command to `uv run main.py`.
2.  Correct the `COPY` command to use `/root/.cache/uv/pythons` as the source and destination for the `uv`-managed Python installations.

  # Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
- # uv will download and install Python 3.12 to /root/.pythons if not available

  RUN uv venv /.venv --seed --python 3.12 \
      && . /.venv/bin/activate \
-     && uv run -s main.py --exit # Note: The '-s' flag here might be an issue, consider 'uv run main.py'
+     && uv run main.py --exit # Corrected: Removed problematic -s flag, main.py is the script to run
  
  # --- Final Stage ---
  # Copy the uv-installed Python distributions from the builder stage
  # This makes the Python interpreter (e.g., Python 3.12) available in the final image
- COPY --from=builder /root/.python /root/.python
+ COPY --from=builder /root/.cache/uv/pythons /root/.cache/uv/pythons
  
  # Copy the virtual environment from the builder stage
- # Symlinks in /.venv/bin/python should now point to a valid interpreter in /root/.pythons
+ # Symlinks in /.venv/bin/python should now point to a valid interpreter in /root/.cache/uv/pythons
  COPY --from=builder /.venv /.venv
  
```

The `Dockerfile` has been updated with the corrected `uv run` command and the accurate path for copying the `uv`-managed Python installations.

Please try building your Docker image again. This should resolve the "not found" error for the Python distribution and also ensure the `uv run` command behaves as expected in the builder stage.

Okay, I can help you with that! We'll change the base image for the `builder` stage from `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm-slim` to a standard Ubuntu image. I'll use `ubuntu:22.04` (a common LTS version) as the new base.

Since the new Ubuntu base image won't have `uv` pre-installed (unlike the previous Astral image), we'll need to add steps to:
1.  Install `curl` and `ca-certificates`, which are needed to download `uv`.
2.  Download and install `uv` using its official installation script.
3.  Ensure that the installed `uv` command is available in the `PATH` for subsequent `RUN` commands.

The rest of your builder stage, including the `uv` environment variables and the commands to create the virtual environment, should then work as before. The `uv` tool will download and set up Python 3.12 as specified.

Here's the edit I'll make to your `Dockerfile`:



---

```diff
- FROM ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.11-bookworm-slim AS builder
+ FROM ubuntu:22.04 AS builder
+ 
+ # Install prerequisites (curl, ca-certificates) and then uv
+ RUN apt-get update && \
+     apt-get install -y curl ca-certificates && \
+     rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
+ RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
+ 
+ # Add uv to PATH. The install script typically places it in /root/.cargo/bin when run as root.
+ ENV PATH="/root/.cargo/bin:${PATH}"
  
  WORKDIR /app
```

---

I've updated your `Dockerfile`. The `builder` stage now uses `ubuntu:22.04` as its base, and includes the necessary steps to install `uv`.

You should be able to rebuild your Docker image with these changes. Let me know how it goes!
