# Adjusting Fuzzing Distance Parameters (2025-05-08 17:49:17)

_**User**_

the fuzzing seems to be too extreme - when we fuzz in a distance, just fuzz a certain number of meters. We don't need fuzzing below 1 m. Here's a chart. 


Decimal Places	Degrees	Distance
0	1.0	111 km
1	0.1	11.1 km
2	0.01	1.11 km
3	0.001	111 m
4	0.0001	11.1 m
5	0.00001	1.11 m
6	0.000001	111 mm
7	0.0000001	11.1 mm
8	0.00000001	1.11 mm

Okay, I understand. You want to adjust the GPS fuzzing logic so that the resulting coordinates are rounded to a precision that doesn't represent changes below approximately 1 meter. Based on the table you provided, 5 decimal places for latitude and longitude correspond to a precision of about 1.11 meters.

I'll make the following changes to `main.py`:
1.  After the `fuzzed_latitude` and `fuzzed_longitude` are calculated, I will add steps to round both of these values to 5 decimal places.
2.  I will update the logging statement to format these rounded coordinates to 5 decimal places (e.g., `:.5f`) to accurately reflect their new precision.

Here's how I'll apply the edit:

```diff
              fuzzed_latitude = current_lat + lat_offset
              fuzzed_longitude = current_lon + lon_offset
+ 
+             # Round to 5 decimal places (precision of ~1.11 meters)
+             fuzzed_latitude = round(fuzzed_latitude, 5)
+             fuzzed_longitude = round(fuzzed_longitude, 5)
  
              working_identity["latitude"] = fuzzed_latitude
              working_identity["longitude"] = fuzzed_longitude
              logger.info(
                  f"Fuzzed coordinates for '{working_identity.get('location')}': "
-                 f"New Lat: {fuzzed_latitude:.6f}, New Lon: {fuzzed_longitude:.6f}"
+                 f"New Lat: {fuzzed_latitude:.5f}, New Lon: {fuzzed_longitude:.5f}"
              )
          else:
```

The changes have been applied to `main.py`. The fuzzed latitude and longitude will now be rounded to 5 decimal places, and the log message will reflect this precision.
