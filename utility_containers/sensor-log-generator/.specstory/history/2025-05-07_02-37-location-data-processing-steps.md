# Location Data Processing Steps (2025-05-06 19:37:57)

_**User**_

the process for this file should be:

start
if location/lat/long provided in identity file, use them.
if any are not provided, AND random_location: enabled is missing/false, exit with error
if any are not provided, AND random_location.enabled is true, then select from the random cities, and use that for sensor ID and lat/long.

Okay, I'll refactor the `process_identity_and_location` function in `main.py` to align with your specified logic.

The new process will be:
1.  If `location` (as a non-empty string), `latitude` (as a number), and `longitude` (as a number) are all provided in the identity file, they will be used.
2.  If any of these are not provided (or not in the correct format) AND `random_location.enabled` in the app configuration is `false` (or the `random_location` setting itself is missing), the script will exit with an error detailing the missing fields.
3.  If any of these are not provided (or not in the correct format) AND `random_location.enabled` is `true`, then a random city (including its name, latitude, and longitude) will be selected from `SensorSimulator.CITIES`. These randomly selected values will then be used to populate/overwrite `location`, `latitude`, and `longitude` in the working identity. The sensor ID will be generated based on this (potentially new) location.

I will now apply these changes to the `process_identity_and_location` function.

The `process_identity_and_location` function in `main.py` has been updated to reflect the new logic.

Here's a summary of the changes:
- It now checks for the presence and correct types of `location` (non-empty string), `latitude` (number), and `longitude` (number) in the identity data.
- If all these fields are valid and present, the function uses them directly.
- If any field is missing or invalid:
    - If `random_location.enabled` is `true` in the configuration, the function now populates `location`, `latitude`, AND `longitude` with data from a randomly selected city from `SensorSimulator.CITIES`. This ensures all three geo-fields are consistent if randomization occurs.
    - If `random_location.enabled` is `false`, it raises a `ValueError` detailing which fields are missing or invalid.
- The sensor ID generation logic now relies on `location` being correctly set by the preceding steps (either from the file or through random generation).
- Logging messages have been updated to reflect the new decision-making process.
- A check for `SensorSimulator.CITIES` availability was added before attempting random selection.
- The safeguard before ID generation now also checks if location is a valid non-empty string.

make sure that "node_identity.json" and "config.yaml" have only known fields - if anything is unknown, or unexpected, then fail immediately with an error

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I'll enhance the `load_identity` and `load_config` functions to validate the loaded data against a predefined set of known fields. If any unexpected fields are encountered, the functions will log an error and raise a `ValueError`.

To do this effectively, I first need to determine all the valid fields for both the identity file and the configuration file. This involves understanding how these dictionaries are used throughout the application, particularly within the `SensorSimulator` class.

I'll start by searching for how `config` and `identity` are accessed in `src/simulator.py`.

The search results from `src/simulator.py` and related files give a good overview.

Based on this, I can define the initial sets of known fields.

**For `node_identity.json` (Identity File):**

*   `id`: string (Sensor ID)
*   `location`: string (City name)
*   `latitude`: number (Latitude coordinate)
*   `longitude`: number (Longitude coordinate)
*   `timezone`: string (e.g., "UTC", "America/New_York")
*   `manufacturer`: string (from `src.enums.Manufacturer`)
*   `model`: string (from `src.enums.Model`)
*   `firmware_version`: string (from `src.enums.FirmwareVersion`)

**For `config.yaml` (Configuration File):**

*   `database`: object
    *   `path`: string (Path to the database file)
*   `logging`: object
    *   `level`: string (e.g., "INFO", "DEBUG")
    *   `format`: string (Log format string)
    *   `file`: string (Optional: Path to the log file)
    *   `console_output`: boolean
*   `random_location`: object
    *   `enabled`: boolean
    *   `cities_file`: string (Optional: path to a custom cities JSON file for `LocationGenerator`)
    *   `gps_variation_km`: number (Optional: for `LocationGenerator`)
*   `simulation`: object
    *   `readings_per_second`: number
    *   `run_time_seconds`: number
*   `replicas`: object (Optional)
    *   `count`: integer
    *   `prefix`: string
    *   `start_index`: integer
*   `sensor`: object (Sensor configuration, likely passed to `ConfigManager`)
    *   *(This can be complex and might have varying sub-fields depending on sensor types. For now, I'll assume `sensor` itself is a known key, and deeper validation might be part of `ConfigManager` or `SensorSimulator` if needed)*
*   `normal_parameters`: object
    *   `temperature`: object with `mean`, `std_dev`, `min`, `max`
    *   `vibration`: object with `mean`, `std_dev`, `min`, `max`
    *   `humidity`: object with `mean`, `std_dev`, `min`, `max`
    *   `pressure`: object with `mean`, `std_dev`, `min`, `max`
    *   `voltage`: object with `mean`, `std_dev`, `min`, `max`
*   `anomalies`: object
    *   `enabled`: boolean
    *   `probability`: number
    *   `types`: object (where keys are anomaly types like "spike", "stuck", "drift")
        *   Each anomaly type (e.g., "spike") can have: `duration_seconds` (number or list/tuple of 2 numbers for range), `severity` (number or list/tuple), `parameters_affected` (list of strings like "temperature").
*   `monitoring`: object (Optional)
    *   `enabled`: boolean
    *   `host`: string
    *   `port`: integer
*   `dynamic_reloading`: object (Optional, used by `ConfigManager`)
    *   `enabled`: boolean
    *   `check_interval_seconds`: number

This is a comprehensive list. The validation logic will need to handle nested objects. A helper function for recursive validation would be good.

I will now proceed to modify `main.py` by adding a validation helper function and integrating it into `load_identity` and `load_config`.

I've added a new helper function `_validate_dict_fields` to `main.py`. This function recursively checks a dictionary against a predefined schema of expected fields and their types (or nested schemas). It also identifies any unexpected fields. A convention of `key_name?` is used in the schema to denote optional keys.

This validation function is now used in both `load_config` and `load_identity`:
1.  **`load_config`**:
    *   Defines `expected_config_fields` based on the comprehensive list derived earlier.
    *   After loading the YAML, it calls `_validate_dict_fields` to validate the structure.
    *   It now also checks if the root of the YAML is a dictionary.
    *   Error handling has been updated to catch and report `FileNotFoundError`, `yaml.YAMLError`, and `ValueError` (for validation errors) more specifically.

2.  **`load_identity`**:
    *   Defines `expected_identity_fields`. Note that `id`, `location`, `latitude`, and `longitude` are marked as optional in this schema because their absence is handled by `process_identity_and_location` (ID generation, random location). Other identity fields like `timezone`, `manufacturer`, etc., are also optional at this stage, though `SensorSimulator` might require some of them later (which it validates in its `__init__` or `_validate_sensor_config`).
    *   After loading the JSON, it calls `_validate_dict_fields`.
    *   It now also checks if the root of the JSON is a dictionary.
    *   Error messages are more specific.

If any unknown fields are found, or if required fields are missing or have incorrect types, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the program will exit with an error message indicating the path to the problematic field (e.g., `config.logging.level` or `identity.unexpected_field`).

This should provide the strict validation you requested for the configuration and identity files.

The error `Unexpected field 'config.simulation' found.` occurs because the validation logic in `_validate_dict_fields` doesn't correctly account for the optional field marker `?` when checking for *unexpected* keys.

Currently, if your `config.yaml` has a key `"simulation"`, the validator checks if `"simulation"` is present in the `expected_fields` dictionary. Since `expected_fields` contains `"simulation?"` (to mark it as optional for presence and type checking), the direct lookup fails, and it's incorrectly flagged as an unexpected field.

The fields `readings_per_second` and `run_time_seconds` are indeed defined under the `simulation` block in your `config.yaml`. The `SensorSimulator` accesses them like this:
`self.readings_per_second = self.config.get("simulation", {}).get("readings_per_second", 1)`
`self.run_time_seconds = self.config.get("simulation", {}).get("run_time_seconds", 3600)`

To fix the validation, I need to modify the first loop in `_validate_dict_fields` which checks for unexpected fields. It should consider a key from the input data valid if either the key itself *or* the key with a `?` suffix exists in the `expected_fields` schema.

I'll make this adjustment to `_validate_dict_fields` in `main.py`.

```diff
      """
      # First, check for unexpected fields
-     for key in data:
-         if key not in expected_fields:
-             error_msg = f"Unexpected field '{path}{key}' found."
+     for key_in_data in data:
+         # A key from data is unexpected if neither key_in_data nor key_in_data + "?" is in expected_fields
+         is_expected = (key_in_data in expected_fields) or (f"{key_in_data}?" in expected_fields)
+         if not is_expected:
+             error_msg = f"Unexpected field '{path}{key_in_data}' found."
              logging.error(error_msg)
              raise ValueError(error_msg)
```

The check for unexpected fields within the `_validate_dict_fields` function in `main.py` has been updated.

Previously, it would incorrectly flag a field like "simulation" (from your `config.yaml`) as unexpected if the schema defined it as "simulation?" (for optionality).

The updated logic now correctly identifies a field from your data as valid if either its exact name or its name appended with a `?` (e.g., "simulation" or "simulation?") is present as a key in the `expected_fields` schema. This ensures that fields intended to be optional and present in your configuration file are not mistakenly rejected.

This change should resolve the `Unexpected field 'config.simulation' found` error you were encountering.

make sure we're using a standard validation library, not writing one ourselves. Here's another error - ❯ CONFIG_FILE=config/config.yaml IDENTITY_FILE=config/node-identity.json uv run -s main.py

You're right, using a standard validation library is a much better practice than maintaining custom validation logic. `Pydantic` is an excellent choice for this in Python due to its ease of use, robustness, and integration with type hints.

The error `Unexpected field 'config.valid_configurations' found` is another instance where your `config.yaml` file has a key that isn't declared in our current `expected_config_fields` schema. Pydantic will help us manage this more cleanly. By default, Pydantic models raise an error if they encounter fields not defined in the model, which aligns with your requirement for strict validation.

Here's the plan:
1.  I'll add `pydantic` to the script's dependencies.
2.  Then, I will define Pydantic models for your configuration (`config.yaml`) and identity (`node_identity.json`) structures.
3.  I'll refactor the `load_config` and `load_identity` functions in `main.py` to use these Pydantic models for parsing and validation, removing the custom `_validate_dict_fields` function.

Let's start by updating the script dependencies.

---

```diff
  #     "psutil",
  #     "requests",
+ #     "pydantic",
  # ]
  # ///
```

---

Okay, I've added `pydantic` to the script's dependencies list.

Now, I'll proceed to define the Pydantic models and refactor `load_config` and `load_identity` in `main.py`. This will involve:
1.  Importing necessary components from `Pydantic`.
2.  Creating Pydantic models that mirror the structure previously defined in `expected_config_fields` and `expected_identity_fields`. I'll use `Optional` from `typing` for fields that are not always required, and define nested models for structured data.
3.  Updating `load_config` to parse the YAML data and then validate it by creating an instance of the Pydantic config model.
4.  Updating `load_identity` to parse the JSON data and then validate it using the Pydantic identity model.
5.  Removing the `_validate_dict_fields` function as it will no longer be needed.
6.  Pydantic models, by default, will raise an error for extra fields (like `valid_configurations` if it's not defined in our model), which aligns with your requirement.
