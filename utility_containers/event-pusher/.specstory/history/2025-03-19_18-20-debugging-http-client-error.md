# Debugging HTTP Client Error (2025-03-19 11:20:29)

_**User**_

what is causing this?



---

_**Assistant**_

Let me investigate this error. The error message indicates there's a missing function body in the HTTP client code, specifically in the vendor directory. Let me check the relevant file.


---

Read file: vendor/github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/pkg/executor/wasm/funcs/http/client/client.go

---


I can see the issue now. The error is occurring because there's a function declaration `httpRequest` that's marked with `//go:wasmimport` directive but doesn't have a function body. This is actually expected behavior for WASM imports, but it seems the Go compiler is not recognizing this properly.

The `//go:wasmimport` directive is used to declare external functions that are implemented in the WASM host environment, but the Go compiler is treating it as a regular function declaration without a body, which is causing the compilation error.

This appears to be a compatibility issue between the Go compiler and the WASM-specific code. The code is using TinyGo-specific features (as indicated by the comment "TinyGo-compatible client"), but it seems you're trying to compile it with the standard Go compiler.

To fix this, you have a few options:

1. Use TinyGo instead of the standard Go compiler for this project
2. Update the vendor dependencies to a version that's compatible with your Go version
3. If you're not actually using WASM functionality, you might want to remove or mock these WASM-specific parts

Would you like me to help you implement any of these solutions? Please let me know which approach you'd prefer to take.

_**User**_

when running this test, use tinygo

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you run the test using TinyGo. First, let me check if TinyGo is installed and then run the test with it.


---

```bash
which tinygo
```

```
‚ùØ which tinygo

---

Great! TinyGo is installed. Now, let's run the test using TinyGo:


---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

how do i run this test JUST over the main_integration.go

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you run the test specifically for `main_integration.go`. First, let me check the contents of that file to ensure we're targeting the right test.


---

Could not find file 'main_integration.go'. Did you mean one of:
- main_integration_test.go

---

Ah, I see - the file is actually named `main_integration_test.go`. Let me check that file:


---

Read file: main_integration_test.go

---

Now I can help you run the test specifically for this file. Since this is a test file in the current directory, we can run it with:



---

```bash
tinygo test -v ./main_integration_test.go
```

```

mmand-line-arguments)
    
```

---

I see the issue. We need to run it from the package context. Let's try this instead:



---

```bash
tinygo test -v .
```

```

‚ùØ
```

---

I see we're running into some compatibility issues with TinyGo. The error suggests that some of the dependencies (specifically k8s.io/utils/net) are not fully compatible with TinyGo. This is common when using TinyGo with packages that use standard library features that TinyGo doesn't fully support.

Let me check the go.mod file to see what dependencies we're working with:


---

Read file: go.mod

---

I see the issue now. This project is using several dependencies that are not fully compatible with TinyGo, particularly the Kubernetes-related packages. The test is designed to run with the standard Go compiler, and it's using features that TinyGo doesn't support.

In this case, I would recommend:

1. Either run the test with the standard Go compiler (which is what it was designed for)
2. Or if you specifically need to use TinyGo, we would need to modify the test to remove dependencies on unsupported features

Would you like me to help you with either of these approaches? The standard Go compiler would be the simpler option since the test was designed for it, but if you specifically need to use TinyGo, we can work on making the necessary modifications.

headers.GetAll undefined (type client.Headers has no field or method GetAll)

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the code to understand this error. It seems there's a mismatch between the expected and actual methods available on the `Headers` type.

---

Let me check the test file to see the context:


---

Read file: main_test.go

---

Let me check the main file to see how the `Headers` type is defined:



---

Read file: main.go

---

I see the issue now. The code is using `client.Headers` from the Bacalhau WASM HTTP client package, but it seems the method `GetAll` is not available in the version being used.

Let me check the actual implementation of the headers type in the vendor directory:



---

Could not find file 'vendor/github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/pkg/executor/wasm/funcs/http/client/headers.go' in the workspace.

---

Let me check what methods are available in the client package:

</details>

---

Let me check the actual implementation of `parseHeaders` in main.go:



---

Read file: main.go

---

I see the issue now. The code is using `client.Headers` as a map type with an `Add` method, but the test is trying to use a `GetAll` method that doesn't exist. The test needs to be updated to use the correct methods available in the `Headers` type.

Let me fix the test:


---

```diff
  	headers = parseHeaders("Content-Type: application/json")
  	assert.Equal(t, 1, len(headers))
- 	values, found := headers.GetAll("Content-Type")
+ 	value, found := headers["Content-Type"]
  	assert.True(t, found)
- 	assert.Equal(t, "application/json", values[0])
+ 	assert.Equal(t, "application/json", value)
  
  	// Test with multiple headers
  	assert.Equal(t, 3, len(headers))
  
- 	values, found = headers.GetAll("Content-Type")
+ 	value, found = headers["Content-Type"]
  	assert.True(t, found)
- 	assert.Equal(t, "application/json", values[0])
+ 	assert.Equal(t, "application/json", value)
  
- 	values, found = headers.GetAll("Authorization")
+ 	value, found = headers["Authorization"]
  	assert.True(t, found)
- 	assert.Equal(t, "Bearer token", values[0])
+ 	assert.Equal(t, "Bearer token", value)
  
- 	values, found = headers.GetAll("Accept")
+ 	value, found = headers["Accept"]
  	assert.True(t, found)
- 	assert.Equal(t, "*/*", values[0])
+ 	assert.Equal(t, "*/*", value)
  }
  
```

---

I've updated the test to use the correct way of accessing headers. The `client.Headers` type is a map type, so we can access values directly using map syntax (`headers["key"]`) instead of using a `GetAll` method.

The changes I made:
1. Changed `headers.GetAll("Content-Type")` to `headers["Content-Type"]`
2. Changed the variable name from `values` to `value` since we're getting a single value
3. Updated the assertions to check the single value instead of an array

This should now work correctly with the actual implementation of the `Headers` type. Try running the test again and it should pass.

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the build error. First, I'll try to run the build command to see the exact error:


---

```bash
go build

‚ùØ
```

---

I see the issue now. The error is coming from the vendor directory, specifically in the Bacalhau WASM HTTP client package. The error indicates that there's a function declaration without a body in `client.go`. This is likely because the code is using WASM-specific features that aren't compatible with the standard Go compiler.

Let me check the go.mod file to see what version of Bacalhau we're using:



---

Read file: go.mod

---

I see the issue now. The project is using a pre-release version of Bacalhau (v1.7.0-rc1) and is also using WASM-specific code. This code is meant to be compiled with TinyGo, not the standard Go compiler.

Let's try building with TinyGo:



---

```bash
tinygo build
```

```

---

I see the problem now. The project is using WASM-specific code from Bacalhau, but it's not properly set up for WASM compilation. The error indicates that it's missing a required WASM symbol.

Let me check if there's a build tag or configuration file that might help us understand how to build this properly:

I see there are some build scripts. Let me check the `build_wasm.sh` script since this seems to be a WASM project:



---

Read file: build_wasm.sh

---

Now I understand the issue. This project is meant to be built as a WASM module, not as a regular Go binary. The build script shows that we need to use TinyGo with specific WASM target flags.

Let's try building it using the provided build script:



---

```bash
chmod +x build_wasm.sh && ./build_wasm.sh
```

Great! The build was successful. The project has been built as a WASM module, which is what it was designed for. The build script created two versions:

1. `bin/event-pusher.wasm` - The full version with HTTP support
2. `bin/event-pusher-nohttp.wasm` - A simulation-only version without HTTP imports

To run the tests, we should use TinyGo's test command with the appropriate WASM target. Let me try that:



---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

ok, this works - but i need to be able to write unit tests that test out specific things locally without violating the wasm/wasi compilation errors with go

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. You want to write unit tests that can run locally with the standard Go compiler, without the WASM/WASI dependencies. This is a common pattern - we can use build tags to separate the WASM-specific code from the regular Go code.

Let me help you restructure this. First, let's check the main code to see what we need to separate:


---

Read file: main.go

---

I see the issue. The code is directly importing and using the WASM HTTP client package. Let's create an interface to abstract the WASM-specific code. Here's how we can restructure this:

1. First, let's create a new file for our interfaces:


---

```diff
- 
+ package main
+ 
+ // HTTPClient defines the interface for HTTP operations
+ type HTTPClient interface {
+ 	// GetMethodConstant converts a string method to its uint32 constant
+ 	GetMethodConstant(method string) (uint32, error)
+ 	// Headers represents HTTP headers
+ 	Headers map[string]string
+ }
+ 
+ // DefaultHTTPClient implements HTTPClient for standard Go
+ type DefaultHTTPClient struct{}
+ 
+ func (c *DefaultHTTPClient) GetMethodConstant(method string) (uint32, error) {
+ 	switch strings.ToUpper(method) {
+ 	case "GET":
+ 		return 0, nil
+ 	case "POST":
+ 		return 1, nil
+ 	case "PUT":
+ 		return 2, nil
+ 	case "DELETE":
+ 		return 3, nil
+ 	case "HEAD":
+ 		return 4, nil
+ 	case "OPTIONS":
+ 		return 5, nil
+ 	case "PATCH":
+ 		return 6, nil
+ 	default:
+ 		return 0, fmt.Errorf("unsupported HTTP method: %s", method)
+ 	}
+ }
+ 
+ // NewHTTPClient creates a new HTTP client based on build tags
+ func NewHTTPClient() HTTPClient {
+ 	return &DefaultHTTPClient{}
+ } 
```

---

Let me fix the interface definition:


---

```diff
  package main
+ 
+ import (
+ 	"fmt"
+ 	"strings"
+ )
  
  // HTTPClient defines the interface for HTTP operations
  type HTTPClient interface {
  	// GetMethodConstant converts a string method to its uint32 constant
  	GetMethodConstant(method string) (uint32, error)
- 	// Headers represents HTTP headers
- 	Headers map[string]string
+ 	// GetHeaders returns the HTTP headers
+ 	GetHeaders() map[string]string
  }
  
  // DefaultHTTPClient implements HTTPClient for standard Go
- type DefaultHTTPClient struct{}
+ type DefaultHTTPClient struct {
+ 	headers map[string]string
+ }
  
  func (c *DefaultHTTPClient) GetMethodConstant(method string) (uint32, error) {
  	}
  }
+ 
+ func (c *DefaultHTTPClient) GetHeaders() map[string]string {
+ 	if c.headers == nil {
+ 		c.headers = make(map[string]string)
+ 	}
+ 	return c.headers
+ }
  
  // NewHTTPClient creates a new HTTP client based on build tags
```

---

Now let's create a WASM-specific implementation in a separate file with build tags:


---

```diff
- 
+ //go:build wasm
+ // +build wasm
+ 
+ package main
+ 
+ import (
+ 	"github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau/pkg/executor/wasm/funcs/http/client"
+ )
+ 
+ // WASMHTTPClient implements HTTPClient for WASM environment
+ type WASMHTTPClient struct {
+ 	headers client.Headers
+ }
+ 
+ func (c *WASMHTTPClient) GetMethodConstant(method string) (uint32, error) {
+ 	switch strings.ToUpper(method) {
+ 	case "GET":
+ 		return client.MethodGet, nil
+ 	case "POST":
+ 		return client.MethodPost, nil
+ 	case "PUT":
+ 		return client.MethodPut, nil
+ 	case "DELETE":
+ 		return client.MethodDelete, nil
+ 	case "HEAD":
+ 		return client.MethodHead, nil
+ 	case "OPTIONS":
+ 		return client.MethodOptions, nil
+ 	case "PATCH":
+ 		return client.MethodPatch, nil
+ 	default:
+ 		return 0, fmt.Errorf("unsupported HTTP method: %s", method)
+ 	}
+ }
+ 
+ func (c *WASMHTTPClient) GetHeaders() map[string]string {
+ 	if c.headers == nil {
+ 		c.headers = make(client.Headers)
+ 	}
+ 	return c.headers
+ }
+ 
+ // Override NewHTTPClient for WASM builds
+ func NewHTTPClient() HTTPClient {
+ 	return &WASMHTTPClient{}
+ } 
```

---

Let me fix those linter errors:



---

```diff
  		c.headers = make(client.Headers)
  	}
- 	return c.headers
+ 	// Convert client.Headers to map[string]string
+ 	result := make(map[string]string)
+ 	for k, v := range c.headers {
+ 		result[k] = v
+ 	}
+ 	return result
  }
  
- // Override NewHTTPClient for WASM builds
- func NewHTTPClient() HTTPClient {
+ // init overrides NewHTTPClient for WASM builds
+ func init() {
+ 	httpClientFactory = func() HTTPClient {
  		return &WASMHTTPClient{}
+ 	}
  }
  
```

---

Let me fix those errors and update the interfaces file to support the factory pattern:


---

```diff
  }
  
- // NewHTTPClient creates a new HTTP client based on build tags
- func NewHTTPClient() HTTPClient {
+ // httpClientFactory is a function that creates a new HTTPClient
+ var httpClientFactory = func() HTTPClient {
  	return &DefaultHTTPClient{}
  }
+ 
+ // NewHTTPClient creates a new HTTP client using the factory
+ func NewHTTPClient() HTTPClient {
+ 	return httpClientFactory()
+ }
  
```

---

Now let me fix the WASM client implementation:



---

```diff
  	result := make(map[string]string)
  	for k, v := range c.headers {
- 		result[k] = v
+ 		if len(v) > 0 {
+ 			result[k] = v[0]
+ 		}
  	}
  	return result
```

---

Now we need to update the main code to use our new interface. Let me check what needs to be changed:

Let me update the main code to use our new interface:


---

```diff
  // getMethodConstant converts a string method to its uint32 constant
  func getMethodConstant(method string) (uint32, error) {
- 	switch strings.ToUpper(method) {
- 	case "GET":
- 		return client.MethodGet, nil
- 	case "POST":
- 		return client.MethodPost, nil
- 	case "PUT":
- 		return client.MethodPut, nil
- 	case "DELETE":
- 		return client.MethodDelete, nil
- 	case "HEAD":
- 		return client.MethodHead, nil
- 	case "OPTIONS":
- 		return client.MethodOptions, nil
- 	case "PATCH":
- 		return client.MethodPatch, nil
- 	default:
- 		return 0, fmt.Errorf("unsupported HTTP method: %s", method)
- 	}
+ 	httpClient := NewHTTPClient()
+ 	return httpClient.GetMethodConstant(method)
  }
  
  // parseHeaders converts a header string to Headers map
- func parseHeaders(headerStr string) client.Headers {
- 	headers := make(client.Headers)
+ func parseHeaders(headerStr string) map[string]string {
+ 	headers := make(map[string]string)
  	if headerStr == "" {
  		return headers
  			key := strings.TrimSpace(parts[0])
  			value := strings.TrimSpace(parts[1])
- 			headers.Add(key, value)
+ 			headers[key] = value
  		}
  	}
```

---

Let me check the rest of the main.go file to see where we need to update the HTTP client usage:


---

Read file: main.go

---

I see we need to update the HTTP client interface to include the Request method. Let me update the interfaces:



---

```diff
  	"strings"
  )
+ 
+ // HTTPResponse represents an HTTP response
+ type HTTPResponse struct {
+ 	StatusCode int
+ 	Headers    map[string][]string
+ 	Body       string
+ }
  
  // HTTPClient defines the interface for HTTP operations
  	// GetHeaders returns the HTTP headers
  	GetHeaders() map[string]string
+ 	// Request makes an HTTP request
+ 	Request(method uint32, url string, headers map[string]string, body string) (*HTTPResponse, error)
  }
  
  	return c.headers
  }
+ 
+ func (c *DefaultHTTPClient) Request(method uint32, url string, headers map[string]string, body string) (*HTTPResponse, error) {
+ 	// For testing purposes, return a mock response
+ 	return &HTTPResponse{
+ 		StatusCode: 200,
+ 		Headers: map[string][]string{
+ 			"Content-Type": {"application/json"},
+ 		},
+ 		Body: `{"status": "success"}`,
+ 	}, nil
+ }
  
  // httpClientFactory is a function that creates a new HTTPClient
```

---

Now let me update the WASM client implementation:



---

```diff
  	return result
  }
+ 
+ func (c *WASMHTTPClient) Request(method uint32, url string, headers map[string]string, body string) (*HTTPResponse, error) {
+ 	// Convert headers to client.Headers
+ 	wasmHeaders := make(client.Headers)
+ 	for k, v := range headers {
+ 		wasmHeaders[k] = []string{v}
+ 	}
+ 
+ 	// Create WASM client
+ 	wasmClient := client.NewClient()
+ 
+ 	// Make the request
+ 	response, err := wasmClient.Request(method, url, wasmHeaders, body)
+ 	if err != nil {
+ 		return nil, err
+ 	}
+ 
+ 	// Convert response to our HTTPResponse type
+ 	return &HTTPResponse{
+ 		StatusCode: int(response.StatusCode),
+ 		Headers:    response.Headers,
+ 		Body:       response.Body,
+ 	}, nil
+ }
  
  // init overrides NewHTTPClient for WASM builds
```

---

Now let me update the main code to use our new interface:



---

```diff
  
  	// Create HTTP client
- 	httpClient := client.NewClient()
+ 	httpClient := NewHTTPClient()
  
  	// Parse headers
```

---

Now we have a clean separation between the WASM-specific code and the standard Go code. The tests should now work with the standard Go compiler since they'll use the `DefaultHTTPClient` implementation, while the WASM build will use the `WASMHTTPClient` implementation.

Try running the tests again with the standard Go compiler:
