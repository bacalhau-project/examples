# Code Style: Maintainability and Conciseness

Write code that is easily maintainable and understandable. Prioritize clarity and simplicity.
Aim for conciseness by avoiding verbosity and boilerplate, but do not sacrifice readability or maintainability for extreme brevity. Code should be as short as effectively possible.
