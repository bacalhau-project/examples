# Python Architecture and Frameworks

Strive to follow standard Python project architecture (e.g., `src/` layout, `tests/` directory, `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependencies).
Prefer well-established and maintained frameworks and libraries over custom solutions where appropriate to ensure broader compatibility and community support.
