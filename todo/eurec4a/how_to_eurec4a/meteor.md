# Meteor

The RV Meteor’s objective during the campaign was to measure along the same cross section of the HALO circle during the
whole campaign to derive statistics of clouds inside this area. For this, the ship was steaming on a north-south
transect between ∼ 12° N and ∼ 14° 30' N. It was equipped with a suite of in situ and remote sensing systems. For
further details please refer to the official eurec4a
[website](http://eurec4a.eu/platforms/rv-meteor) and the cruise report {cite:p}`Mohr:2020`.
