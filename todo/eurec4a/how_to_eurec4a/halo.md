# HALO

The German High Altitude and Long-Range Research Aircraft (HALO) operated by the Deutsches Zentrum f√ºr Luft- and Raumfahrt (DLR) was equiped with remote sensing instruments and a facility to launch dropsondes. All instruments and PIs are listed on the official [eurec4a](http://eurec4a.eu/platforms/halo) webpage.


During EUREC4A HALO flew most of the time at about 9 km altitude circular patterns with 200 km diameter centered at 57.72W, 13.30N.
On typical flight days an excursion to the NTAS buoy or a satellite underpass separated the first three from the remaining three circles. Typically, the aircraft stayed up in the air for 8-9 hours per day starting at varying times in the morning to capture the diurnal cycle.
