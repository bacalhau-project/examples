# Project Status

## Overview
This project implements a log generation and processing system using Bacalhau for distributed computing. It includes Terraform configurations for infrastructure deployment and Docker containers for log generation.

## Completed Tasks
### Infrastructure
- [x] Removed Tailscale configurations and updated to use public IPs
- [x] Updated cloud-init configuration for GCP instances
- [x] Created orchestrator configuration with log processing directory mount
- [x] Added proper volume mounting for log directories
- [x] Integrated log generator deployment in Terraform
- [x] Added automatic container deployment during VM creation

### Log Generator
- [x] Implemented Docker-based log generator
- [x] Added log rotation with 5-minute schedule
- [x] Fixed Python dependencies in Docker container
- [x] Implemented cross-device log copying
- [x] Added proper file permissions and user management
- [x] Added verbose logging for logrotate operations

### Configuration
- [x] Implemented environment variable configuration for Docker Compose
- [x] Organized log generator files into proper directory structure
- [x] Created example configuration files
- [x] Added proper Python dependency management with pyproject.toml

## Current State
### Components
- Log Generator
  - Containerized Python application
  - Generates logs using Faker library
  - Rotates logs every 5 minutes
  - Copies logs to processing directory
  - Runs as non-root user (appuser)
  - Uses proper volume mounts

- Log Processing Pipeline
  - Log files generated in /var/log/app
  - Rotation every 5 minutes via logrotate
  - Files copied to /var/log/logs_to_process
  - Original logs truncated after copy
  - Compressed archives for processed logs
  - Timestamp-based naming for uniqueness

- Infrastructure
  - GCP-based deployment
  - Cloud-init for instance setup
  - Terraform for infrastructure management
  - Automated log generator deployment
  - Proper directory permissions and ownership
  - Integrated Docker Compose setup

### Configuration
- Environment variables managed through:
  - .env file for Docker Compose (auto-generated)
  - .env.json for Terraform
  - cloud-init for instance configuration
- Log generator files deployed via cloud-init:
  - Python script
  - Dependencies
  - Configuration files
  - Docker Compose setup

## Next Steps
### 1. Testing (Priority: High)
- [ ] Add integration tests for log generator
- [ ] Test log rotation functionality
- [ ] Verify log processing directory mounting in Bacalhau jobs
- [ ] Add unit tests for Python code
- [ ] Test log rotation across different mount points
- [ ] Add end-to-end pipeline tests

### 2. Documentation (Priority: High)
- [ ] Add detailed setup instructions
- [ ] Document environment variables and configuration options
- [ ] Add architecture diagram
- [ ] Document log format and rotation schedule
- [ ] Add pipeline flow documentation
- [ ] Document Bacalhau job configuration

### 3. Log Processing (Priority: High)
- [ ] Implement Bacalhau job for log processing
- [ ] Add DuckDB queries for log analysis
- [ ] Create processing results visualization
- [ ] Implement error handling for failed processing
- [ ] Add processing metrics collection

### 4. Improvements (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Add monitoring for log generation
- [ ] Implement log backup strategy
- [ ] Add health checks for the log generator container
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Add metrics collection
- [ ] Implement log validation before processing

### 5. Infrastructure (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Add support for multiple regions
- [ ] Implement auto-scaling
- [ ] Add backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Implement infrastructure monitoring
- [ ] Add processing node management

## Known Issues
### Critical
None

### Important
1. Need to implement proper error handling in log generator
2. Need to add monitoring for log rotation process

### Minor
1. Missing detailed documentation
2. No monitoring solution in place

## Recent Changes
### Added
- Terraform integration for log generator
- Automatic container deployment
- Cloud-init file provisioning
- Directory permission management
- Log generator containerization
- 5-minute log rotation schedule
- Cross-device log copying
- Proper user permissions
- Python dependency management with pyproject.toml

### Modified
- Updated cloud-init configuration
- Enhanced Terraform deployment
- Improved file provisioning
- Updated log rotation configuration
- Improved Docker container security
- Fixed volume mounting issues
- Updated Python dependencies

### Fixed
- Cross-device log copying issues
- File permission issues
- Configuration file organization
- Log rotation scheduling

## Notes
### Development
- Current focus is on stabilizing the log generation and processing pipeline
- Need to implement proper testing framework
- Consider adding monitoring and alerting
- Next phase focuses on Bacalhau processing implementation
- Terraform now handles complete deployment

### Operations
- Log rotation is working as expected
- Files are properly copied to processing directory
- Non-root user is properly configured
- Cron and logrotate are working together
- Ready for processing pipeline implementation
- Log generator automatically deployed with VM
- All required files properly provisioned

### Future Considerations
- Potential migration to Kubernetes
- Integration with external logging systems
- Scaling strategy for multiple regions
- Implementation of monitoring and alerting system
- Advanced log analysis with DuckDB
- Real-time processing capabilities
