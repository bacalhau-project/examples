Hello from Bacalhau! üêüüê†üê°

This message shows that your job is running correctly on your Bacalhau environment.

To generate this output, Bacalhau took the following steps:
 1. The Bacalhau client received your job request and sent it to the orchestrator.
 2. The orchestrator selected an appropriate compute node from the network.
 3. The compute node pulled the Docker image from the specified registry.
 4. The container was launched in a secure, isolated environment.
 5. The job executed and gathered system information about its runtime environment.
 6. The results were captured and returned through the Bacalhau network.

To try something more ambitious, you can:

 - Run GPU-enabled workloads (https://bac.al/using-gpus-on-bacalhau)
 - Mount your own S3 bucket (https://bac.al/running-with-s3)
 - Use IPFS to store your data (https://bac.al/using-ipfs)
