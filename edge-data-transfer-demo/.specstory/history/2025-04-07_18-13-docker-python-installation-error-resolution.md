_**Assistant**_

I see the issue - the error is occurring because the Python environment in the Docker container is externally managed, and we're trying to install `uv` directly with `pip`. Let's modify the Dockerfile to properly install `uv` using the recommended approach.

I'll edit the Dockerfile to:
1. Install `python3-full` which is needed for creating virtual environments
2. Create a virtual environment
3. Install `uv` within that virtual environment


---

```diff
  
  RUN apt-get update
- RUN apt-get install python3 python3-pip curl unzip mc vim nano openssh-client -y
+ RUN apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-full python3-venv curl unzip mc vim nano openssh-client -y
+ 
+ # Create and activate virtual environment
+ RUN python3 -m venv /opt/venv
+ ENV PATH="/opt/venv/bin:$PATH"
+ 
+ # Install uv in the virtual environment
  RUN pip install uv
  
  
  RUN ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "" -f /root/.ssh/id_rsa
- 
  
  CMD ["sleep", "infinity"]
```

---

I've made the following changes to fix the Python package installation issue:

1. Added `python3-full` and `python3-venv` to the apt-get install command to ensure we have the necessary packages for creating virtual environments
2. Created a virtual environment at `/opt/venv`
3. Added the virtual environment's bin directory to the PATH
4. Now `uv` will be installed in the virtual environment instead of system-wide

This should resolve the "externally-managed-environment" error you were seeing. The virtual environment approach is the recommended way to handle Python package installations in this case, as it keeps the system Python installation clean and isolated from the packages we need to install.

Try rebuilding the Docker image now - the error should be resolved.

_**User**_

how do i override this? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I see you're trying to override the command in the Dockerfile. In Docker Compose, you can override the CMD from the Dockerfile by specifying a different command in your docker-compose.yml file.

Looking at your docker-compose.yml, I can see you already have a `command` field set to `["sleep", "infinity"]`. This is actually overriding the CMD from your Dockerfile. 

If you want to run a different command, you can modify the `command` field in your docker-compose.yml. For example, if you want to run a shell instead of sleeping, you could change it to:

```yaml
command: ["/bin/bash"]
```

Or if you want to run a specific Python script:

```yaml
command: ["python3", "your_script.py"]
```

The command you specify in docker-compose.yml will take precedence over the CMD in your Dockerfile. You can also use the `entrypoint` field if you need more control over how the container starts.

Would you like me to help you set up a specific command to override the current one?

_**User**_

switch this to apk

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the Dockerfile to use Alpine Linux's package manager `apk` instead of Debian's `apt`. Since we're using the `bacalhau:v1.7.0-dind` base image which is based on Alpine Linux, this is the correct approach.



---

```diff
  WORKDIR /backend
  
- RUN apt update
- RUN apt install python3 python3-pip curl unzip mc vim nano openssh-client -y
+ RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache \
+     python3 \
+     py3-pip \
+     curl \
+     unzip \
+     mc \
+     vim \
+     nano \
+     openssh-client
+ 
  RUN curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  
```

---

I've made the following changes:
1. Replaced `apt update` and `apt install` with `apk update && apk add`
2. Used `--no-cache` flag to keep the image size smaller
3. Changed `python3-pip` to `py3-pip` which is the correct package name in Alpine
4. Combined the update and install into a single RUN command to reduce layers
5. Formatted the package list for better readability

The rest of the Dockerfile remains the same. This should now work correctly with the Alpine-based base image.

_**Assistant**_

This warning appears when Docker Compose is trying to stop containers that are attached to a network that no longer exists. This typically happens when:

1. The network was removed while containers were still running
2. There was an unclean shutdown of the containers
3. The network configuration in docker-compose.yml changed

To fix this, you can try the following steps:

1. First, let's clean up any existing containers and networks:


---

Cancelled

---

2. Then, let's verify the network configuration in your docker-compose.yml. I notice that your network is defined as:

```yaml
networks:
  bacalhau-network:
```

This is correct, but let's make sure all services are properly connected to it. I can see that all your services are indeed connected to the `bacalhau-network`, so that's not the issue.

3. Try running with the `--force-recreate` flag to ensure a clean start:

Based on the search results, I can see that the hostname configuration is set in multiple places:

1. In `bacalhau-config/compute.yaml`, there's a `NameProvider: hostname` setting which tells Bacalhau to use the system's hostname for node identification.

2. In `docker-compose.yml`, the orchestrator service has a specific hostname set:
```yaml
services:
  orchestrator:
    hostname: orchestrator
```

3. The hostname `g2ku0y0g0y4o04.us1.cloud.expanso.io` appears to be coming from the cloud environment where the Bacalhau nodes are running. This is likely set by the cloud provider (Expanso Cloud) when the instances are created.

The hostname is being used in the following ways:
1. For node identification in the Bacalhau network
2. For communication between nodes
3. For the frontend to connect to the backend services

If you want to change this hostname, you would need to:
1. Either modify the cloud instance configuration where the nodes are running
2. Or update the `NameProvider` setting in `bacalhau-config/compute.yaml` to use a different naming scheme

Would you like me to help you modify any of these configurations?

_**Assistant**_

I see the issue. The backend nodes are trying to connect to an invalid API host address. Let's fix this by properly configuring the orchestrator address in the compute configuration.

Let me check the compute configuration file:



---

Read file: bacalhau-config/compute.yaml

---

I see the issue. The compute nodes are trying to connect to the orchestrator using NATS (port 4222), but they also need the API host configuration. Let's modify the compute.yaml file to include the correct API host configuration:




---

```diff
  UpdateConfig:
    Interval: 0
+ API:
+   Host: orchestrator
+   Port: 1234
  
```

---

I've added the API configuration to point to the orchestrator service. This should fix the connection issues because:

1. The `Host: orchestrator` matches the hostname we set in docker-compose.yml for the orchestrator service
2. The `Port: 1234` matches the port that the orchestrator is listening on (as seen in the logs: `Starting server backend=http://0.0.0.0:1234`)

Now try running `docker compose up` again. The backend nodes should be able to connect to the orchestrator properly, and the frontend should also be able to reach the orchestrator's API.

If you still see issues, we might need to:
1. Check if the orchestrator is properly exposing its API port
2. Verify the network connectivity between containers
3. Check if there are any firewall rules blocking the connections

Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

_**Assistant**_

Let me help you verify and fix the DNS resolution within the containers. First, let's check if the network is properly set up and if DNS resolution is working.

Let's try to inspect the network and containers:



---

```bash
docker network inspect bacalhau-network | cat
```

```
daaronch@M2-Max ~/c/b/edge-data-transfer-demo (main)> docker network inspect bacal
hau-network | cat
                                                      docker network inspect bacal
hau-network | cat

[]

```

---

I see the issue - the network doesn't exist. Let's try to recreate the network and containers. First, let's stop and remove everything:




---

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

```
daaronch@M2-Max ~/c/b/edge-data-transfer-demo (main)> docker compose down --remove
-orphans
                                                      docker compose down --remove

I've made several important changes to improve DNS resolution:

1. Added explicit network aliases for each service
2. Configured the network with a specific subnet
3. Added proper network configuration for each service

I see we're still getting the error about `g2ku0y0g0y4o04.us1.cloud.expanso.io`. Let me check the orchestrator configuration:

---

Read file: bacalhau-config/orchestrator.yaml

---

The issue seems to be that there's still a reference to `g2ku0y0g0y4o04.us1.cloud.expanso.io` somewhere in the configuration. Let me search for it in all configuration files:

---

<details>
            <summary>Grep search for "g2ku0y0g0y4o04" • **0** files</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Let me check if it's in the environment file:

---

Read file: .env

---

The .env file is empty. Let's create it with the correct configuration:

---

Cancelled

---

Let me check if there are any other configuration files that might contain this reference:

| 📄 `orchestrator.yaml` |

</details>

---

Let me check the compute.yaml file again to see if there might be any hidden characters or issues:

---

Read file: bacalhau-config/compute.yaml

---

Let's try to modify the compute.yaml to use the container name instead of the hostname:

Now let's try running the stack again:

allow setting the --no-cache to reset the cache

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll modify the build_container.sh script to add a --no-cache option that will be passed to the docker buildx build command.



---

```diff
  fi
  
+ # Check for --no-cache option
+ NO_CACHE=""
+ if [ "${1:-}" = "--no-cache" ] || [ "${2:-}" = "--no-cache" ]; then
+     NO_CACHE="--no-cache"
+     log "Building without cache"
+ fi
  
  # Create and use buildx builder if it doesn't exist
      -t "${REMOTE_TAG}" \
      -t "${LATEST_REMOTE_TAG}" \
+     ${NO_CACHE} \
      -f Dockerfile . ; then
      error "Failed to build Docker container"
  
  # Push to registry if requested
- if [ "${1:-}" = "--push" ]; then
+ if [ "${1:-}" = "--push" ] || [ "${2:-}" = "--push" ]; then
      # Check if user is logged into GitHub Container Registry
      if ! docker login ghcr.io >/dev/null 2>&1; then
```

---

I've made the following changes to the build_container.sh script:

1. Added a `NO_CACHE` variable that can be set to `--no-cache` when the option is provided
2. Added logic to check for `--no-cache` in either the first or second argument position
3. Added the `${NO_CACHE}` variable to the docker buildx build command
4. Updated the `--push` check to look in both argument positions since we now have two possible options

Now you can use the script in the following ways:
- `./build_container.sh` - normal build with cache
- `./build_container.sh --no-cache` - build without cache
- `./build_container.sh --push` - build and push with cache
- `./build_container.sh --no-cache --push` - build without cache and push

The script will now properly handle the `--no-cache` option and pass it through to the docker buildx build command, which will force a fresh build without using any cached layers.

_**Assistant**_

I see what's happening. The files you're seeing in the container are coming from the Docker build context. When you run `docker buildx build`, Docker includes all files in the current directory (and subdirectories) in the build context, unless explicitly excluded in a `.dockerignore` file.

In this case, it looks like:
1. The build is happening in the `edge-data-spots` directory
2. The Dockerfile is using `COPY scripts/ ./` to copy files
3. The entire project directory structure is being included in the build context

To fix this, you should:

1. Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files:


---

```diff
- 
+ # Exclude everything except what's needed
+ *
+ !scripts/
+ !Dockerfile
+ !build_container.sh 
```

---

2. Let's also check what's in the scripts directory to make sure we're only copying what's needed:



---

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory edge-data-spots/scripts • **5** results</summary>
        
| Name |
|-------|
| 📄 `disable-network.sh` |
| 📄 `disable-nfs.sh` |
| 📄 `enable-network.sh` |
| 📄 `enable-nfs.sh` |
| 📄 `generate.py` |

</details>

---

Now you can rebuild the container with the `.dockerignore` file in place. This will:
1. Exclude all files by default
2. Only include the `scripts/` directory, `Dockerfile`, and `build_container.sh`
3. Keep the build context clean and minimal

Try rebuilding with:
```bash
./build_container.sh --no-cache
```

This should result in a much cleaner container with only the necessary files. The files you were seeing before were being included in the build context unnecessarily, which is why they appeared in the container even though they weren't explicitly copied.

I see the issue. The containers are having trouble resolving the hostname "orchestrator" because we need to ensure proper DNS resolution within the Docker network. Let's modify the docker-compose.yml to use the container's service name instead of the hostname for DNS resolution.

Let's update the docker-compose.yml:



---

```diff
    orchestrator:
      <<: *orchestrator-image
-     hostname: orchestrator
+     container_name: orchestrator
      command: serve -c /etc/bacalhau/config.yaml --name orchestrator
      environment: *common-env-variables
    storage:
      image: quay.io/minio/minio
+     container_name: storage
      entrypoint: sh
      command: -c 'mkdir -p /data/my-bucket && minio server /data --console-address ":9001"'
    frontend:
      image: ghcr.io/bacalhau-project/edge-data-dashboard:202504071534
+     container_name: frontend
      entrypoint: ["/entrypoint.sh"]
      environment:
```

---

Now let's also update the compute.yaml configuration to use the correct hostname:




---

```diff
    Interval: 0
  API:
-   Host: orchestrator
+   Host: edge-data-transfer-orchestrator-1
    Port: 1234
  
```

I've made several changes to improve DNS resolution:

1. In docker-compose.yml:
   - Removed the `hostname` field and replaced it with `container_name`
   - Added explicit `container_name` for each service
   - Kept the network aliases for DNS resolution

2. In compute.yaml:
   - Updated the API host to use the full container name `edge-data-transfer-orchestrator-1`

The key changes are:
1. Using `container_name` instead of `hostname` for more reliable DNS resolution
2. Using the full container name in the configuration
3. Keeping the network aliases for additional DNS entries

Try running `docker compose up` again. The containers should now be able to resolve each other's hostnames correctly.

If you still see issues, we can try:
1. Using the container's IP address directly
2. Adding explicit DNS configuration to the network
3. Using Docker's internal DNS service

Let me know if you need any adjustments!
