# Setting Environment Variables for Build (2025-04-07 13:38:01)

_**User**_

make sure IMAGE_NAME and LOCAL_TAG are set as env variables before building.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the `build_container.sh` script to set `IMAGE_NAME` and `LOCAL_TAG` as environment variables before building. I'll edit the file to make these changes.


---

```diff
  REGISTRY="ghcr.io"    
  ORGANIZATION="bacalhau-project"      
- IMAGE_NAME="event-pusher"
- LOCAL_TAG="event-pusher:latest"
+ export IMAGE_NAME="event-pusher"
+ export LOCAL_TAG="event-pusher:latest"
  REMOTE_TAG="${REGISTRY}/${ORGANIZATION}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${TIMESTAMP}"
  LATEST_REMOTE_TAG="${REGISTRY}/${ORGANIZATION}/${IMAGE_NAME}:latest"
```

---

I've modified the script to export `IMAGE_NAME` and `LOCAL_TAG` as environment variables by adding the `export` keyword before their definitions. This means these variables will be available in the environment when the build command is executed.

The changes ensure that:
1. `IMAGE_NAME` and `LOCAL_TAG` are properly exported to the environment
2. The values remain the same as before
3. The rest of the script's functionality remains unchanged

The variables will now be available in the environment when the Docker build command is executed, which can be useful if you need to reference these values in other parts of your build process or if you want to make them available to child processes.

_**User**_

no. check to make sure they are in the local environment, or exit

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. You want to verify that these environment variables exist in the local environment before proceeding with the build. I'll modify the script to check for these environment variables and exit if they're not set.



---

```diff
  REGISTRY="ghcr.io"    
  ORGANIZATION="bacalhau-project"      
- IMAGE_NAME="event-pusher"
- LOCAL_TAG="event-pusher:latest"
+ 
+ # Check for required environment variables
+ if [ -z "${IMAGE_NAME:-}" ]; then
+     error "IMAGE_NAME environment variable is not set"
+ fi
+ 
+ if [ -z "${LOCAL_TAG:-}" ]; then
+     error "LOCAL_TAG environment variable is not set"
+ fi
+ 
  REMOTE_TAG="${REGISTRY}/${ORGANIZATION}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${TIMESTAMP}"
  LATEST_REMOTE_TAG="${REGISTRY}/${ORGANIZATION}/${IMAGE_NAME}:latest"
```

---

I've modified the script to:
1. Remove the hardcoded values for `IMAGE_NAME` and `LOCAL_TAG`
2. Add checks to verify that these environment variables are set in the local environment
3. Use the `${VAR:-}` syntax to safely check for unset variables
4. Exit with an error message if either variable is not set

Now the script will:
- Check if `IMAGE_NAME` is set in the environment
- Check if `LOCAL_TAG` is set in the environment
- Exit with an error message if either is missing
- Proceed with the build only if both variables are properly set

This ensures that the build will only proceed when these environment variables are properly configured in the local environment.
