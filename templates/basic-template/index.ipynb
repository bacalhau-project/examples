    "# Title of Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a basic example of using notebooks to create examples. It demonstrates some of ipython's basic features to achieve common Bacalhau tasks. Other more advanced templates are available in the [templates](../templates) directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why a Notebook?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are great because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Readers can \"execute\" the documentation. They can not only read the example, but try it!\n",
    "* They are testable. We can run the notebook in CI and check that it works.\n",
    "* They are interactive. Readers can alter the notebooks and play with the code.\n",
    "* They are great for hackathons. Just point people to the notebook and get hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens to This Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few CI scripts that operate on notebooks:\n",
    "* Whenever you push to the main branch on this repository, a github action will automatically render your ipynb's into markdown and push them to the [docs repository](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/docs.bacalhau.org/).\n",
    "* Whenever you push, pytest will run to ensure that all notebooks execute without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* We use Python as the kernel for our notebooks. This is the most common kernel and is used in our tests.\n",
    "* Large datafiles should not be stored in the repo. Store data in either the GCS bucket or IPFS (depending on the example).\n",
    "* Make sure all cells run successfully to pass tests. If a cell takes a very long time you may want to skip tests. See below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "All examples must exist within a directory. The notebook should be called `index.ipynb` (so that it gets rendered as the index.html page in the docs). You may have other supporting files in the directory. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "basic-template\n",
    "├── Dockerfile\n",
    "├── README.md\n",
    "├── example-image.jpg\n",
    "├── index.ipynb\n",
    "└── small-toy-dataset.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control some elements of the documentation rendering by adding metadata to the notebook. This is done by adding a raw cell at the top of the notebook. The metadata is in YAML format. See the top of this file for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working With Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "The following demonstrates how to work with bash commands in a notebook. Note that these commands execute within the context of your kernel. If you don't have the required dependencies installed, you will need to install them first. Read more about [working with bash in notebooks](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html#magic-bash).\n",
