# SQLite Database Read-Only Confirmation (2025-05-28 19:56:28)

does this write to the sqlite database at all? it should always only read only

Looking at the code, I can confirm that **the script only reads from the SQLite database and never writes to it**. Here's why:

1. **All SQLite connections use read-only mode** - Every connection to the SQLite database explicitly uses the `?mode=ro` (read-only) parameter:

   ```python
   # In read_data function (line 196)
   db_uri = f"file:{str(sqlite_path)}?mode=ro"
   
   # For table detection (line 720)
   db_uri_meta = f"file:{str(sqlite_path)}?mode=ro"
   
   # For column detection (line 751)
   db_uri_meta_cols = f"file:{str(sqlite_path)}?mode=ro"
   
   # For counting records (line 804)
   conn_count = sqlite3.connect(f"file:{str(sqlite_path)}?mode=ro", uri=True)
   
   # For reading data (line 826)
   db_uri_data = f"file:{str(sqlite_path)}?mode=ro"
   
   # For checking remaining records (line 1424)
   conn_remaining = sqlite3.connect(f"file:{str(sqlite_path)}?mode=ro", uri=True)
   ```

2. **Only SELECT queries are executed** - The script only performs read operations:
   - `SELECT * FROM {table_name}` 
   - `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM {table_name}`
   - `PRAGMA table_info()` (for schema inspection)
   - Other metadata queries

3. **PRAGMA statements don't modify data** - While the script sets some PRAGMAs like `journal_mode=WAL` and `busy_timeout`, these are:
   - Session-specific settings that don't modify the database file
   - Applied to read-only connections anyway

4. **All writes go elsewhere**:
   - Data is written to **Databricks** (the destination)
   - State tracking is written to a **JSON file** (`.last_upload.json`)
   - Debug output may create **temporary Parquet files** (when verbose mode is on)

The script is correctly implemented as a read-only consumer of the SQLite database, ensuring data integrity of the source database.

The traceback you've provided indicates an `AttributeError` because `ParamEscaper.escape_path` is being called, but it no longer exists or has been renamed in the `databricks-sql-connector` library. This typically happens when code isn't updated to match changes in its dependencies.

In the latest version of the `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script that we worked on (the one that is approximately 1497 lines long), this issue has already been addressed:

1.  A helper function `quote_databricks_identifier` was introduced to correctly quote Databricks SQL identifiers (like catalog, database, and table names) using backticks.
2.  All instances where `ParamEscaper.escape_path` was used for database or table names have been replaced with calls to this new `quote_databricks_identifier` function or the `get_qualified_table_name` function (which itself uses `quote_databricks_identifier`).
3.  The import `from databricks.sql.utils import ParamEscaper` was removed, as it's no longer needed for this purpose.

The error you're encountering suggests you might be running a version of the script that doesn't include these latest changes. The file snippet attached in your current message (lines 1-33 of `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`) still shows `from databricks.sql.utils import ParamEscaper`, which is indicative of the older version.

Please ensure you are using the most recent version of the script, which incorporates the `quote_databricks_identifier` function and removes the direct usage of `ParamEscaper.escape_path`. This version should resolve the `AttributeError` you're experiencing.
