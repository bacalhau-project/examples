# Databricks Parquet Upload Error Troubleshooting (2025-05-28 14:52:23)

_**User**_

please fix what went wrong here.

also, the upload to the volume should be a unique name, based on the timestamp. - 1748469122_sensor_data.parquet' into '`sensor_data`.`readings`'.

The user is encountering a `PARQUET_TYPE_ILLEGAL` error, which indicates an incompatibility between the timestamp format in the Parquet file and what Databricks `COPY INTO` expects. Pandas, by default, writes timestamps with nanosecond precision (`datetime64[ns]`), which can cause this issue. We can resolve this by coercing the timestamps to microsecond precision when writing the Parquet file.

Additionally, the user requested a specific filename format for the uploaded Parquet files on the volume: `{timestamp}_{base_name}.parquet`. The current implementation includes an `upload_batch_` prefix, which I will remove.

I'll make the following changes:
1.  Modify the `df.to_parquet()` call to use `engine='pyarrow'` and `coerce_timestamps='us'` to write timestamps with microsecond precision.
2.  Update the `file_name` generation to match the requested format.

Applying these changes now.

```

The Parquet timestamp coercion and filename format have been updated in `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`.

The `df.to_parquet` call now includes `engine="pyarrow"`, `coerce_timestamps="us"`, and `allow_truncated_timestamps=True`. This ensures that timestamps are written with microsecond precision, which is compatible with Databricks.
The filename format for uploaded Parquet files has been changed from `upload_batch_{current_time_for_filename}_{base_name}.parquet` to `{current_time_for_filename}_{base_name}.parquet` as requested.

Please test the script again to see if these changes resolve the issue.

The current timestamp conversion logic in your script correctly converts timestamps to UTC but makes a simplifying assumption: if a timestamp string from SQLite is naive (has no timezone information), it's assumed to be UTC. However, your SQLite schema includes an `original_timezone` column, which suggests that naive timestamps might actually represent local times in that specified timezone.

I'll update the script to correctly use the `original_timezone` column:
1.  After parsing the timestamp string column into datetime objects, iterate through each timestamp.
2.  If a timestamp is naive (has no timezone information):
    *   Check if a corresponding `original_timezone` value exists for that row and is a valid timezone string.
    *   If yes, localize the naive timestamp to this `original_timezone`, then convert it to UTC.
    *   If no `original_timezone` is available, or if it's invalid, log a warning and fall back to assuming the naive timestamp is UTC (localizing it to UTC).
3.  If a timestamp is already timezone-aware (parsed from a string that included timezone information), convert it directly to UTC.
4.  Ensure the final timestamp column in the DataFrame is of type `datetime64[ns, UTC]`.

This approach ensures all timestamps are consistently in UTC before being written to Parquet, while correctly respecting the local timezone information if provided.

I'm applying the changes to the timestamp conversion logic in `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`.

The timestamp conversion logic in `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` has been updated.

Here's a summary of the changes:
*   When converting the timestamp column (e.g., `timestamp_field`) from strings to `datetime` objects, the script now iterates over each timestamp.
*   If a parsed timestamp is naive (lacks timezone information), the script attempts to read the corresponding value from the `original_timezone` column for that row.
    *   If `original_timezone` contains a valid timezone string (e.g., "America/New\_York"), the naive timestamp is first localized to that timezone, then converted to UTC.
    *   If `original_timezone` is missing, empty, or contains an invalid timezone string, a warning is logged, and the naive timestamp is assumed to be UTC (localized directly to UTC).
*   If a parsed timestamp is already timezone-aware (meaning the string in SQLite contained timezone offset information), it's directly converted to UTC.
*   After this processing, the entire timestamp column is explicitly cast to `datetime64[ns, UTC]` to ensure consistency.

This revised logic should correctly handle timestamps from SQLite, respecting their original timezones if provided, and converting everything to UTC before writing to Parquet and uploading to Databricks.

Please test this updated script.

Thank you for providing the sample data. This is very helpful.

Key observations from your data:
1.  The `timestamp` column (e.g., `2025-05-28T21:50:38.660+00:00`) already includes a UTC offset (`+00:00`).
2.  The `original_timezone` column (e.g., `-04:00`) stores a UTC offset string, not an IANA timezone name (like "America/New\_York").

With the script's current logic (after my last edit):
*   When `pd.to_datetime()` processes the `timestamp` string, it will correctly interpret the `+00:00` and create a timezone-aware datetime object that is already in UTC.
*   In the `ensure_utc` helper function, since the timestamp is already timezone-aware, it will take the path that simply calls `ts_val.tz_convert('UTC')`. Because `ts_val` is already UTC, this operation is idempotent and correct.
*   The `original_timezone` column would not be used for conversion in this specific scenario because the timestamp derived from the `timestamp` column is never naive.

This means the script, as it stands, **will correctly process your sample data** and ensure the timestamps are in UTC for Databricks.

However, I can make a small improvement to the part of the code that handles *hypothetical* naive timestamps. If, in some other scenario, the `timestamp` column *did* produce a naive datetime (e.g., `2025-05-28 17:50:38.660` without any offset) and `original_timezone` contained an offset string like `-04:00`, the previous logic using `tz_localize(original_tz_str)` would fail (as `tz_localize` expects an IANA timezone name) and fall back to assuming the naive timestamp was UTC.

I'll refine this specific part to correctly apply an offset string from `original_timezone` to a naive timestamp. This makes the script more robust for varied inputs, though it won't change the outcome for your provided sample data where the main `timestamp` is already UTC.

Here's the change to the naive timestamp handling block within `ensure_utc`:

The logic for handling naive timestamps (timestamps without timezone information) has been refined. If a naive timestamp is encountered and an `original_timezone` string is available:
1. It now tries to apply `original_timezone` directly using `pd.Timestamp(ts_val, tz=original_tz_str)`. This constructor is more flexible and can often handle offset strings (like "-04:00") or IANA timezone names directly.
2. If successful, this localized timestamp is then converted to UTC.
3. If this fails (e.g., `original_timezone` is an IANA name and `pytz` isn't available, or the format is unrecognized), it logs a warning and falls back to localizing the naive timestamp to UTC.

For your provided sample data where the `timestamp` column *already includes UTC offset information*, this change will not alter the behavior; the script was already correctly processing those timestamps to UTC. This refinement improves robustness for scenarios where the `timestamp` column might yield naive datetimes and `original_timezone` contains a simple offset.

No further changes should be needed for correct timestamp handling with the data you've shown.
