# Local File vs Databricks Host Writing (2025-05-26 18:29:05)

_**User**_

why is this writing to a local file instead of the databricks host?

---

_**Assistant**_

The script `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` uses the `deltalake` library to write data. The `write_deltalake` function determines the destination (local file system or remote Databricks table) based on its first argument (in your script, `databricks_table_name`) and the provided `storage_options`.

Here's why it might be writing to a local file instead of your Databricks host:

1.  **Format of `databricks_table_name`**:
    *   If `databricks_table_name` is a simple string that looks like a path (e.g., "my_delta_table", or "./my_data") and not a fully qualified Databricks table name (e.g., `catalog_name.schema_name.table_name`), the `deltalake` library will interpret it as a local path and create a Delta table in a directory with that name on your local filesystem.
    *   The script intends for `databricks_table_name` to be a fully qualified name or a DBFS path, as noted in its comments (around line 282).

2.  **Missing or Incorrect Databricks Connection Details (`storage_options`)**:
    *   To write to a Databricks table (especially in Unity Catalog), the `deltalake` library typically requires connection and authentication details. The script attempts to configure these using `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` within the `storage_options` passed to `write_deltalake` (lines 244-254 and 280-286).
    *   If `DATABRICKS_HOST` or `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` are missing, incorrect, or not properly picked up by the library, `deltalake` might not be able to connect to your Databricks workspace.
    *   In such a scenario, if `databricks_table_name` is a string that *could* be a local directory name (e.g., "metrics_table"), `deltalake` might default to creating it locally.
    *   The script includes warnings (lines 138-143 and 250-252) if these Databricks connection parameters are not fully specified, highlighting that they are crucial for authenticated access.

3.  **Combined Effect**:
    *   If you provide a `databricks_table_name` like "example_table" (without specifying catalog and schema) AND the Databricks host/token are not correctly configured or available to `deltalake`, the library will most likely create a local directory named `example_table` and write the Delta table there.

To ensure the script writes to your Databricks host:
*   Make sure the `databricks_table_name` you provide (via CLI argument `--table`, environment variable `DATABRICKS_TABLE`, or the config file) is a fully qualified Databricks table name (e.g., `your_catalog.your_schema.your_table`).
*   Ensure that `DATABRICKS_HOST` (e.g., `https://<your-workspace>.cloud.databricks.com`) and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` (your Personal Access Token) are correctly set (via CLI arguments, environment variables, or the config file) so they are passed in the `storage_options`. The script attempts to prepend `https://` to the host if it's missing the scheme (lines 246-250).

this should never write locally, only to the deltalake in the cloud

Okay, I understand. You want to modify the script `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` to ensure it exclusively writes to a Databricks Delta table in the cloud and never to a local file.

To achieve this, I'll make two key changes:
1.  **Make Databricks Host and Token Mandatory**: The script currently warns if the Databricks host (`--databricks-host` or `DATABRICKS_HOST`) or token (`--databricks-token` or `DATABRICKS_TOKEN`) are not provided. I will change this to an error, causing the script to exit if these are not specified. This ensures that the `deltalake` library is always configured with credentials to target a remote Databricks workspace.
2.  **Validate Databricks Table Name Format**: I will add a validation step to check the format of the `databricks_table_name` (provided via `--table`, `DATABRICKS_TABLE`, or config). The script will require this name to be either:
    *   A fully qualified Unity Catalog table name (e.g., `catalog.schema.table`, containing at least two periods).
    *   A DBFS path (starting with `dbfs:/`).
    If the table name doesn't match these formats (e.g., if it's a simple name like `mytable` or a local-like path), the script will exit with an error. This prevents the `deltalake` library from potentially interpreting an ambiguous name as a local path.

These changes together will make sure the script is always explicitly configured for cloud writes.

I'll apply these modifications to the `main()` function in your script.

The changes have been applied to `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py`.

The script will now:
1.  Exit if Databricks host and token are not provided, ensuring it's configured for cloud access.
2.  Exit if the Databricks table name is not a fully qualified Unity Catalog name (e.g., `catalog.schema.table`) or a DBFS path (e.g., `dbfs:/path/to/table`), preventing accidental local writes.

This should robustly enforce that all writes are directed to your Databricks workspace in the cloud.
