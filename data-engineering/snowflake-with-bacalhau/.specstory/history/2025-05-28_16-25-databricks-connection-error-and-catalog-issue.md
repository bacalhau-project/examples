It looks like there's a discrepancy in the catalog name being used.

The `simple_test.py` script, which runs successfully, uses the catalog `bacalhau_catalog`.
However, the traceback from `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` shows it's trying to access a catalog named `databrick_with_bacalhau`. This seems to be a typo.

The `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script is configured using the `../databricks-uploader-config.yaml` file. The error most likely stems from an incorrect `databricks_catalog` value in that YAML file.

I'll check the contents of `../databricks-uploader-config.yaml` to confirm and then correct the typo.

I've found the configuration file. Now I'll read its contents.

---

Could not find file '../databricks-uploader-config.yaml' in the workspace.

---

It seems I used the wrong path for the config file. The `file_search` result indicates the correct path is `/Users/daaronch/code/bacalhau-examples/data-engineering/databricks-with-bacalhau/databricks-uploader-config.yaml`. I'll try reading it again with the correct path.

---

Read file: /Users/daaronch/code/bacalhau-examples/data-engineering/databricks-with-bacalhau/databricks-uploader-config.yaml

---

The configuration file `databricks-uploader-config.yaml` has `databricks_catalog: "bacalhau_catalog"`. This is correct.

However, the traceback clearly states: `[NO_SUCH_CATALOG_EXCEPTION] Catalog 'databrick_with_bacalhau' was not found.`

This is puzzling. The `simple_test.py` script uses the correct catalog name (`bacalhau_catalog`) and works fine. The `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script *should* be getting the catalog name from the same configuration file, but the error message suggests it's using `databrick_with_bacalhau`.

Let's examine how `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` reads the configuration. I'll search for how it uses the `databricks_catalog` configuration.

The search results are a bit overwhelming, and don't immediately point to where `databricks_catalog` is being read or used in `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`. The script `simple_test.py` defines `TARGET_CATALOG` directly, it does not read it from the config file.

It seems `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` uses `databricks_database` and `databricks_table` from the config/args to construct the table path, but it's not immediately clear if or how it uses `databricks_catalog`.

The error `[NO_SUCH_CATALOG_EXCEPTION] Catalog 'databrick_with_bacalhau' was not found` is very specific.

It's possible that:
1.  The `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script has a hardcoded or incorrectly constructed catalog name somewhere.
2.  There's an environment variable that's overriding the config file, and it has the typo. The script prioritizes command-line arguments, then environment variables, then the YAML config.
3.  The `databricks.sql.connect` or other Databricks library calls are inferring the catalog in a way that leads to this typo, perhaps from another part of the configuration or environment.

Let's look at the `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script more closely. I'll read the whole file to understand how it handles the catalog.

---

Read file: databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py

---

I've read the first 200 lines of `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`.

The script defines arguments such as `--databricks-database` and `--databricks-table`. It also reads these from environment variables (e.g., `DATABRICKS_DATABASE`) and the YAML configuration file.

The `get_qualified_table_name` function (lines 43-67) constructs a table name like `` `schema_name`.`table_name` ``. It uses the `databricks_database` value as the schema if the provided table name isn't already qualified.

Crucially, there's no explicit command-line argument, environment variable, or YAML configuration key named `databricks_catalog` being parsed or used directly in the initial part of the script to form the *fully qualified table name* which includes the catalog.

The Databricks SQL `INSERT` statement (around line 780 in the full script, based on the traceback) is failing with a `NO_SUCH_CATALOG_EXCEPTION`. This suggests that the connection itself, or a `USE CATALOG` statement, is where the incorrect catalog `databrick_with_bacalhau` is being introduced.

The traceback starts at `cursor_db.execute()`. We need to see what SQL command is being executed there and how the connection `conn_db` (and its cursor `cursor_db`) was established and configured, specifically regarding the catalog.

Let's look at the section of `main()` where the Databricks connection is made for the upload operation.

---

Read file: databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py

---

Okay, I've reviewed the relevant section (lines 766-838) of `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`.

Here's what happens:
1.  A Databricks connection `conn_db` is established using `databricks.sql.connect()` with `server_hostname`, `http_path`, and `access_token` (lines 771-776). **The catalog is not specified at connection time.**
2.  A cursor `cursor_db` is created.
3.  `cursor_db.execute(f"USE {quote_databricks_identifier(databricks_database)}")` is called (lines 780-782). This sets the *database (schema)* but not the *catalog*.
4.  `table_name_qualified_for_insert` is generated by `get_qualified_table_name(databricks_database, databricks_table)` (lines 786-788). This function constructs a name like `` `schema`.`table` ``. It does **not** prepend a catalog.
5.  The `INSERT INTO` statement uses this `table_name_qualified_for_insert` (line 795).

The problem is that the Databricks SQL endpoint needs to know which catalog to operate on. If a catalog is not specified in the connection parameters or by a `USE CATALOG <catalog_name>` statement, Databricks might default to a session-specific catalog or another default, which might not be what's intended.

The error message `[NO_SUCH_CATALOG_EXCEPTION] Catalog 'databrick_with_bacalhau' was not found` strongly implies that *somewhere* this incorrect catalog name is being set or inferred for the session.

Given that `simple_test.py` works and explicitly does `USE CATALOG {TARGET_CATALOG}`, and the config file `databricks-uploader-config.yaml` *correctly* specifies `databricks_catalog: "bacalhau_catalog"`, the uploader script is missing the step to set the catalog.

The fix is to add a `USE CATALOG` command in `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` similar to how `USE <database>` is called.

First, the script needs to read the `databricks_catalog` from the config/args/env. Then, after connecting and before `USE <database>`, it should execute `USE CATALOG <catalog_name>`.

I will now prepare the edit for `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`.
I'll add:
1.  Logic to read `databricks_catalog` similar to how `databricks_database` and `databricks_table` are read.
2.  A `cursor_db.execute(f"USE CATALOG {quote_databricks_identifier(databricks_catalog)}")` call.

This is the plan:
1.  Modify `parse_args()` to include an argument for `--databricks-catalog`.
2.  In `main()`, read `databricks_catalog` from args, environment variables (`DATABRICKS_CATALOG`), or the YAML config, similar to other Databricks parameters.
3.  Add `databricks_catalog` to the list of required parameters for the script to run.
4.  After establishing the Databricks connection and creating a cursor, and *before* executing `USE <databricks_database>`, add the line: `cursor_db.execute(f"USE CATALOG {quote_databricks_identifier(databricks_catalog)}")`
5.  Also, in the `--run-query` mode, the same `USE CATALOG` statement should be added.

The changes have been applied to `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`.
I've added the necessary logic to:
1.  Parse the `--databricks-catalog` command-line argument.
2.  Read the `databricks_catalog` value from command-line arguments, environment variables (`DATABRICKS_CATALOG`), or the YAML configuration file (`databricks_catalog`), in that order of precedence.
3.  Include `databricks_catalog` in the list of required parameters and in the validation checks.
4.  In both the main upload logic and the `--run-query` mode, execute `USE CATALOG <catalog_name>` after connecting to Databricks and before other database operations.

The `get_qualified_table_name` function still returns `schema.table` because the `INSERT INTO` statement works with `USE CATALOG <catalog>; USE <schema>; INSERT INTO <table>`.

With these changes, the script should now correctly use the `bacalhau_catalog` specified in your `databricks-uploader-config.yaml` file, and the `NO_SUCH_CATALOG_EXCEPTION` for `databrick_with_bacalhau` should be resolved.

You can now try running the `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script again.

It seems we've run into a new issue: a `PARSE_SYNTAX_ERROR` from Databricks, pointing to the `%s` placeholders in the `INSERT` statement.

The `databricks-sql-connector` uses `?` as the parameter marker, not `%s`. This is a common source of confusion as different database connectors in Python use different placeholder styles.

I need to change the line that generates the placeholders in `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py`.

Currently, it's (around line 814):
`placeholders = ", ".join(["%s"] * len(columns))`

This should be changed to:
`placeholders = ", ".join(["?"] * len(columns))`

I'll make this quick change.

---

```diff
                              quote_databricks_identifier(col) for col in df.columns
                          ]
-                         placeholders = ", ".join(["%s"] * len(columns))
+                         placeholders = ", ".join(["?"] * len(columns))
                          insert_sql_template = f"INSERT INTO {table_name_qualified_for_insert} ({', '.join(columns)}) VALUES ({placeholders})"
  
```

---

The placeholder style in the `INSERT` statement has been corrected from `%s` to `?`.

This should resolve the `PARSE_SYNTAX_ERROR`. You can try running the `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script again.

_**User**_

is there a more efficient way to bulk upload 500 at a time?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're right to ask about efficiency, especially when dealing with potentially large volumes of data. While `executemany` with `INSERT INTO ... VALUES ...` for 500 rows at a time is better than row-by-row inserts, Databricks offers more optimized methods for bulk ingestion, particularly into Delta Lake tables (which your `simple_test.py` script creates).

The most common and highly recommended approach for significantly more efficient bulk uploads, especially when your script is running outside of the Databricks environment but connecting to a SQL Warehouse (as your script does), is to use the **`COPY INTO` SQL command**.

Here's how it generally works and why it's more efficient:

1.  **Stage Data in Cloud Storage:**
    *   Instead of directly inserting rows via SQL, your Python script would first collect a batch of data from SQLite (e.g., all new rows since the last upload).
    *   This batch would be saved as a file (or multiple files) in an efficient format, typically **Parquet** (due to its columnar nature, compression, and schema support, which works very well with Delta Lake) or CSV.
    *   This file is then uploaded to a staging location in cloud storage that Databricks can access (e.g., an S3 bucket, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, or Google Cloud Storage).

2.  **Execute `COPY INTO`:**
    *   Your Python script would then use the `databricks-sql-connector` to execute a `COPY INTO` command.
    *   This command tells Databricks to load data directly from the specified file(s) in cloud storage into your target Delta table.
    *   Example: `COPY INTO bacalhau_catalog.sensor_data.readings FROM 's3://your-bucket/path/to/your-file.parquet' FILEFORMAT = PARQUET;`

**Why is `COPY INTO` more efficient?**

*   **Optimized for Bulk Loads:** Databricks has heavily optimized `COPY INTO` for ingesting large volumes of data. It can parallelize the read from cloud storage and the write to the Delta table.
*   **Reduced Network Overhead:** Instead of sending potentially thousands of individual SQL `INSERT` statements and data values over the network, you send one command to ingest a (potentially large) file.
*   **Transactional and Idempotent:** `COPY INTO` is transactional. It also has mechanisms to avoid reprocessing files that have already been loaded, making it suitable for reliable data pipelines.
*   **Schema Handling:** It can handle schema inference and evolution to some extent.

**What would this change in your script?**

1.  **Dependencies:** You'd need to add a Python library for interacting with your chosen cloud storage service (e.g., `boto3` for AWS S3, `azure-storage-blob` for Azure, `google-cloud-storage` for GCS).
2.  **Logic Flow:**
    *   Read data from SQLite into a Pandas DataFrame (as you currently do).
    *   Instead of the loop with `executemany`:
        *   If the DataFrame is not empty, convert it to Parquet format and save it to a temporary local file.
        *   Upload this Parquet file to your designated cloud storage staging area.
        *   Execute the `COPY INTO` command via `cursor_db.execute()`.
        *   Optionally, clean up the local temporary file and possibly the staged file in cloud storage after successful ingestion (or implement a lifecycle policy on your storage).
3.  **Configuration:** You'd need to add configuration for cloud storage (bucket name, credentials/authentication method for Databricks to access the storage). Databricks needs appropriate permissions to read from the staging location.

The "batch size" of 500 would no longer apply to individual `INSERT` statements. Instead, the "batch" would be the entire set of new rows read from SQLite in one cycle, which would be written to a single Parquet file (or a few, if you decide to split very large batches). This can be much larger than 500 rows.

This approach generally provides a substantial performance improvement for uploading more than a few thousand rows at a time.

Would you like me to outline the specific code changes and new configurations needed to implement the `COPY INTO` strategy using AWS S3 as an example for cloud storage? This would be a more significant refactoring than the previous changes.

---

_**User**_

i don't want to have to store a file on s3 or elsewhere. I only want to interact with the databricks api

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I understand you want to avoid using intermediate cloud storage like S3 and stick to interacting directly with the Databricks API, presumably through the existing `databricks-sql-connector`.

Without staging files, the most dramatic bulk ingestion methods like `COPY INTO` (from external storage) are off the table. However, we can still optimize the current approach using `executemany`.

The main lever you have is the **batch size** used for the `cursor_db.executemany()` call. Currently, it's hardcoded at 500 rows:
`batch_size = 500  # Configurable or fixed batch size` (around line 818)

The `databricks-sql-connector` is designed to be efficient (it uses Apache Arrow for data transfer under the hood when possible), and sending larger batches can often be more performant than many small batches because it reduces the per-batch overhead.

**Suggestion for Improvement:**

1.  **Make `batch_size` Configurable:** Instead of a hardcoded value, we can make this configurable, for example, through the YAML configuration file and/or a command-line argument. This will allow you to experiment easily.
2.  **Experiment with Larger Batch Sizes:** Once configurable, you can try increasing the `batch_size` (e.g., to 1000, 5000, 10000, or even higher). The optimal size will depend on:
    *   The average size of your rows.
    *   Network latency between your script and the Databricks SQL warehouse.
    *   The resources allocated to your SQL warehouse.
    There will be an upper limit beyond which you might see diminishing returns or even errors (e.g., if the total size of the batched SQL statement or data becomes too large for a single request).

**Implementation Plan:**

I will modify the script to:
1.  Add a `--databricks-batch-size` command-line argument.
2.  Allow `databricks_batch_size` to be specified in the YAML configuration.
3.  Use this configured value (with a sensible default if not provided) for the `batch_size` variable.

This will give you the flexibility to tune this parameter for better throughput.

Let's proceed with these changes.

I've made the `batch_size` for Databricks uploads configurable.

Here's a summary of the changes:
1.  Added a `--databricks-batch-size` command-line argument.
2.  The script will now look for `DATABRICKS_BATCH_SIZE` in environment variables.
3.  It will look for `databricks_batch_size` in the YAML configuration file.
4.  The order of precedence is: CLI argument > Environment Variable > YAML config > Default (which is 500).
5.  The `batch_size` used in the upload loop now respects this new configuration.

You can now control the batch size by:
*   Passing `--databricks-batch-size <number>` on the command line.
*   Setting the `DATABRICKS_BATCH_SIZE` environment variable.
*   Adding `databricks_batch_size: <number>` to your `../databricks-uploader-config.yaml` file.

For example, to use a batch size of 2000, you could add this to your YAML:
```yaml
# ... other configurations ...
databricks_batch_size: 2000
# ... rest of configurations ...
```

You can now experiment with different batch sizes to see what yields the best performance for your specific setup and data. Start by increasing it gradually (e.g., 1000, 2000, 5000) and monitor the upload times and any potential errors.

if there is no written timestamp, recording the last upload, then assume nothing has been written.

Make sure to record the timestamp of the last batch written in a flat file, in the same directory as the script.

_**Assistant**_

You've made some excellent improvements to the script with verbose logging, reset options, and more detailed batch processing!

Regarding your latest requests:

1.  **"If there is no written timestamp, recording the last upload, then assume nothing has been written."**
    Your current logic, especially with the `--reset-state` flag and how `last_ts` is initialized to `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` if the state file doesn't exist or can't be read, already handles this correctly. This "epoch start" timestamp effectively ensures all actual data from your SQLite database will be considered new.

2.  **"Make sure to record the timestamp of the last batch written in a flat file, in the same directory as the script."**
    The script currently updates the `last_upload.json` file with the maximum timestamp from the successfully processed data, which accurately reflects the "high watermark" of uploaded data.
    The main change needed is to adjust the *default* location of this state file. Currently, it defaults to a `/state` directory if not otherwise specified.

I'll modify the script so that if `state_dir` is not specified via the command line (`--state-dir`), environment variable (`STATE_DIR`), or YAML configuration (`state_dir`), it will default to the directory where the `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script itself is located. The state file will continue to be named `last_upload.json` within that directory.

Here's the planned modification to the `main()` function for determining `state_dir`:

---

```diff
      # These parameters are only essential if not in query mode (which exits early)
      sqlite_path = Path(args.sqlite or os.getenv("SQLITE_PATH") or cfg.get("sqlite", ""))
-     state_dir = Path(
-         args.state_dir or os.getenv("STATE_DIR") or cfg.get("state_dir", "/state")
-     )
+     # NEW: Get limit value from args
+     limit = args.limit
+ 
+     # Determine the script's directory to use as a default for state_dir
+     script_dir = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
+     state_dir_path_str = args.state_dir or os.getenv("STATE_DIR") or cfg.get("state_dir")
+ 
+     if state_dir_path_str:
+         state_dir = Path(state_dir_path_str)
+     else:
+         state_dir = script_dir  # Default to script's directory
+     logging.info(f"Using state directory: {state_dir.resolve()}")
+ 
      interval = int(
          (
```

```diff
          args.timestamp_col or os.getenv("TIMESTAMP_COL") or cfg.get("timestamp_col")
      )
- 
-     # NEW: Get limit value from args
-     limit = args.limit
  
      # Validate required parameters for normal mode
```

---

The script has been updated. The `state_dir` will now default to the directory containing the `sqlite_to_databricks_uploader.py` script if it's not specified via the `--state-dir` argument, the `STATE_DIR` environment variable, or the `state_dir` key in the YAML configuration file.

This addresses your request to have the state file (`last_upload.json`) stored in the same directory as the script by default. The logic for handling the timestamp itself was already in line with your requirements.

---

_**User**_

make sure the statefile is stored with a '.' prefix so that it is not added to .git by default.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, that's a good refinement to prevent the state file from being inadvertently tracked by Git.

I'll change the name of the state file from `last_upload.json` to `.last_upload.json`. This will make it a hidden file on Unix-like systems and less likely to be picked up by default Git rules.

The change will be in the `main()` function where `state_file` is defined.

---

```diff
      # Prepare state file directory
      state_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
-     state_file = state_dir / "last_upload.json"
+     state_file = state_dir / ".last_upload.json"  # Changed to hidden file
  
      # NEW: Handle reset state flag

The state file name has been changed to `.last_upload.json`. It will now be a hidden file, which should help prevent it from being accidentally committed to Git.

The script is now configured as per your requests.

give me some more information about what was uploaded, first time stamp, last time stamp, and how many un-uploaded items remain in the sqlite db.

You're looking for more detailed feedback after each successful upload cycle. That's a great idea for better monitoring!

Here's the plan to add the requested information to the logs:

1.  **After a successful upload of a batch (`if upload_successful:` and `if not df.empty:`):**
    *   Determine the **first timestamp** in the uploaded batch: `df[timestamp_field].min()`.
    *   The **last timestamp** in the uploaded batch is already available (it's what `new_ts` gets set to, which then updates `last_ts`).
    *   Log both these timestamps in a human-readable format (ISO format).
2.  **Query SQLite for remaining records:** After the batch is uploaded and `last_ts` is updated in memory (but before writing to the state file), run a new `COUNT(*)` query on the SQLite database for records with `timestamp > last_ts`.
    *   Log this count.

I'll modify the script to include these additional logging details.

The logic for applying the changes seems to have slightly misaligned the `last_ts` update.
The intention was:
1. Get `max_epoch_val` from the current `df`.
2. Convert this to `new_ts`.
3. If `new_ts` is valid and actually newer than the `last_ts` from the *previous* cycle, then update `last_ts` to `new_ts`.
4. *Then*, use this *newly updated* `last_ts` to query for remaining records.

The diff shows `last_ts` being updated *before* the comparison `last_ts > old_last_ts_for_remaining_check`. This will always make `last_ts > old_last_ts_for_remaining_check` true if `new_ts` was different from `old_last_ts_for_remaining_check`.

Let me correct the application of the edit. The `new_ts` variable should be used for the comparison, and only if the comparison passes, `last_ts` should be updated to `new_ts`.

I'll re-apply the logic carefully.

The changes have been applied, and the logic for updating `last_ts` and logging the batch details should now be correct.

Here's a summary of the new logging you'll see after a successful data upload:
1.  `INFO: First timestamp in uploaded batch: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff+00:00`
2.  `INFO: Last timestamp in uploaded batch: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff+00:00` (This will be the timestamp used for the next cycle's starting point)
3.  `INFO: Updated last timestamp to: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffff+00:00` (Confirmation of the state update)
4.  `INFO: Remaining records in SQLite after this batch: <count>`

This should give you a much clearer picture of what's happening during each upload cycle.

when i issue sequential queries on the databricks query editor, it keeps seeming that only one row at a time are being loaded. The query i keep running is 'select count(*) from readings."

We don't need to print out every POST, just the ONE post for the bulk upload, and then the result for that post.

You're hitting on a couple of important points: how Databricks reflects counts after inserts and how to manage logging verbosity.

**1. `SELECT COUNT(*)` in Databricks Query Editor:**

When you run `SELECT COUNT(*)` in the Databricks UI, especially rapidly after an insert, what you observe can be influenced by a few factors:

*   **Eventual Consistency & Caching:** Databricks, like many distributed systems, might have slight delays (eventual consistency) in how quickly metadata updates (like table counts) are reflected across all parts of the system, including the UI. The UI itself might also have caching. The data *is* committed by the script with ACID guarantees by Delta Lake, but the UI's view might take a moment to catch up.
*   **Transaction Batches:** Your script sends data in batches (e.g., 500 rows at a time if `databricks_batch_size` is 500). If you have, say, 2000 new records, the script makes four separate `executemany` calls to Databricks. If you run `SELECT COUNT(*)` in the UI *while this process is ongoing* (e.g., after the first 500 are inserted but before the next 1500), you'll see an intermediate count.
    *   The script logs `"Successfully inserted {len(data_to_insert)} new records..."` *after all batches for the current cycle* have been attempted.
    *   If you have `--verbose` enabled, the script also logs `"Total records in target table after insert: {result[0]}"`. This count is taken by the script itself *after* its current upload cycle is complete and should be a more reliable indicator from the script's perspective of what was just committed. If this number looks correct in your script's logs but the UI is different, it's likely UI lag.

**In summary for counts:** Trust the script's final verbose log for the cycle. The Databricks UI will catch up. The important part is that the data is durably written to the Delta table.

**2. Reducing Verbose HTTP Logging from `databricks-sql-connector`:**

The lines like `INFO Received status code 200 for POST request` are indeed generated by the underlying `databricks-sql-connector` library. We can make these less chatty by specifically setting the logging level for this library to be less verbose (e.g., `WARNING`) without affecting your script's own detailed logging (which is controlled by `--verbose`).

I'll add a line to `main()` to adjust the `databricks.sql` logger's level. This will quiet down those specific HTTP status messages while still allowing your script to provide its own useful `INFO` and `DEBUG` logs.

---

```diff
      log_level = logging.DEBUG if args.verbose else logging.INFO
      logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s")
+ 
+     # Reduce verbosity of the databricks-sql-connector's logger
+     logging.getLogger("databricks.sql").setLevel(logging.WARNING)
  
      # 1) load YAML if supplied
```

---

I've added the line to set the `databricks.sql` logger to the `WARNING` level. This should significantly reduce the number of HTTP POST status messages you see in the console, making your script's own logs easier to follow.

Your script's logging (controlled by the `--verbose` flag) will remain as is. This change only affects the internal logging from the `databricks-sql-connector` library.

This should address your concerns about both the perceived row-by-row loading (which is more about UI refresh and batching) and the excessive HTTP logging.

is there any way to upload 500 items (or even just 50 items) in a single POST query?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely. The `cursor_db.executemany(insert_sql_template, batch_data)` command you're using is specifically designed for this purpose.

When you use `executemany()`:

1.  You provide a single SQL template (`insert_sql_template`) with placeholders (`?`).
2.  You provide a list of tuples (`batch_data`), where each tuple contains the values for one row to be inserted.

The `databricks-sql-connector` then takes this information and sends it to the Databricks SQL Warehouse in an optimized way. While the exact number of HTTP POST requests for an `executemany` call is an internal detail of the connector and the underlying Thrift protocol it uses, the core idea is to be much more efficient than sending one HTTP POST per row.

**It's highly probable that for a batch of 50 or 500 items, the connector sends the command and all the parameter sets for that batch in a single, more complex HTTP request (or a very small number of them), rather than 50 or 500 individual HTTP POSTs.**

The `executemany` interface is the standard way in Python's DB API 2.0 (which `databricks-sql-connector` largely follows) to perform bulk operations. The connector is expected to handle the batching efficiently on your behalf.

The previous change we made to set `logging.getLogger("databricks.sql").setLevel(logging.WARNING)` was to reduce the noise from the connector's *own* verbose logging about every HTTP interaction. This doesn't change how `executemany` works; it just makes the console output cleaner by hiding those specific low-level HTTP log messages. The batching still occurs.

So, your current approach using `executemany` with a `databricks_batch_size` (e.g., 500) *is* the correct and efficient way to upload multiple items in a more optimized fashion, leveraging the capabilities of the `databricks-sql-connector` to handle the communication with the Databricks backend effectively. You are not making 500 separate INSERT queries that each result in a distinct POST; `executemany` is designed to avoid that.

if this is the case, then why are so many POSTs being issued? And there appears to be one POST per row?
