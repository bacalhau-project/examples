You're encountering that error because PySpark, the Python API for Apache Spark, indeed requires Java to run. Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Does PySpark require Java?**
    Yes. Apache Spark (which PySpark uses under the hood) is written in Scala, a language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). When you execute a PySpark script, it starts a JVM process to carry out the Spark operations. The error message "Unable to locate a Java Runtime" confirms that your system cannot find a Java installation for PySpark to use.

2.  **Can't we write to Databricks Delta Lake without Java?**
    Yes, it is possible to write to Databricks Delta Lake from Python without needing a local Java installation by using alternative libraries. The most common one for this is the `deltalake` Python library.
    *   This library provides Python bindings for `delta-rs`, which is a native Rust implementation of the Delta Lake protocol. It can read and write Pandas DataFrames directly to Delta tables stored in various locations (like DBFS, S3, Azure Data Lake Storage).
    *   Interestingly, your script has a commented-out line: `# Removed: from deltalake import write_deltalake`. This suggests that an earlier version of the script might have used this Java-free approach.

    However, switching your current script from PySpark to the `deltalake` library would involve several changes:
    *   **Removing PySpark:** You'd remove `pyspark` from your dependencies and eliminate all PySpark-specific code (e.g., `SparkSession` initialization, `spark.createDataFrame()`, and `spark_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable(...)`).
    *   **Table Specification:** The `deltalake` library's `write_deltalake()` function typically writes to a *storage path* of a Delta table (e.g., `dbfs:/mnt/your_delta_lake_table`, `s3://your-bucket/path/to/table/`). This is different from PySpark's `saveAsTable("catalog.schema.table")` method, which can directly use the three-part table name common in Databricks Unity Catalog. While `deltalake` can work with Unity Catalog, using the three-part name directly for writes without Spark might require knowing the table's underlying storage location.
    *   **Databricks Connection:** Authentication for `deltalake` usually relies on environment variables like `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` for DBFS access, or cloud-specific credentials if writing to object storage directly. The Databricks Connect specific parameters (`--cluster-id`) would no longer be used in the same way.

**Your Current Script's Design:**
The script `sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` is currently set up to use PySpark with Databricks Connect. This is clear from:
*   The dependency on `pyspark>=3.4.0`.
*   The code `SparkSession.builder.appName(...).remote(...)` for connecting to a Databricks cluster.
*   The use of `spark_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable(databricks_table_name)`.

**What would you like to do?**

1.  **Install Java to make the current PySpark script work:**
    This is the most direct solution if you want to keep the script's current logic, especially the `saveAsTable()` functionality with named tables. You would typically install a JDK (Java Development Kit), version 8, 11, or 17 are common choices compatible with recent Spark versions. Ensure `JAVA_HOME` is set and Java is in your system's PATH.

2.  **Refactor the script to use the `deltalake` library (No Java needed):**
    If avoiding a local Java installation is a priority, we can modify the script. This would involve replacing PySpark with `deltalake` for writing data. You'd likely need to provide the DBFS path to your target Delta table instead of (or in addition to) the `catalog.schema.table` name.

Please let me know which approach you'd prefer, and I can help with the next steps.

can we do it with just raw python? @https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/tutorial 

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can interact with Databricks Delta Lake using "raw Python" without PySpark and its Java dependency by using the `deltalake` Python library. This library allows you to read and write Delta tables directly.

The tutorial you linked ([Tutorial: Delta Lake](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta/tutorial)) primarily shows examples using PySpark, Scala, and SQL, which are common ways to interact with Delta Lake within the Databricks environment (e.g., in a Databricks notebook). However, for an external Python script like yours, `deltalake` is an excellent alternative if you want to avoid the Java/PySpark setup.

Here's how it would impact your script and what changes would be needed:

1.  **Dependencies**:
    *   Remove `pyspark` from your `dependencies` list in the script's header.
    *   Add `deltalake` to the `dependencies` list. It seems like it was there before, judging by the `# Removed: from deltalake import write_deltalake` comment.

2.  **SparkSession Removal**:
    *   All code related to `SparkSession` (builder, initialization, remote connection, stopping the session) would be removed. This includes the Databricks Connect specific parameters like `--cluster-id`, as `deltalake` doesn't use Spark clusters in the same way.

3.  **Data Writing**:
    *   Instead of converting the Pandas DataFrame to a Spark DataFrame and using `spark_df.write.format("delta").mode("append").saveAsTable(databricks_table_name)`, you would use a function like `deltalake.write_deltalake()`.
    *   This function takes a Pandas DataFrame and a path to the Delta table.

4.  **Table Identification and Path**:
    *   The `deltalake` library typically writes to the *storage path* of the Delta table (e.g., a DBFS path like `dbfs:/mnt/your_delta_lake_table/`, or an S3/ADLS path if your table is external).
    *   Your current script uses `saveAsTable("catalog.schema.table")`, which directly references a Unity Catalog table name. To use `deltalake` with Unity Catalog tables:
        *   You might need to resolve the `catalog.schema.table` name to its underlying storage location if it's an external table.
        *   For managed Unity Catalog tables, `deltalake` can interact with them if your environment (where the script runs) is correctly configured with `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` environment variables. The library can then use these to work with paths that look like `uc:/catalogs/<catalog_name>/schemas/<schema_name>/tables/<table_name>`.
        *   Alternatively, you'd need to know the DBFS path for the managed table if you want to write to its path directly.
    *   The arguments `--databricks-catalog` and `--databricks-schema` could still be used to construct the full table path for `deltalake` if it supports UC paths directly or if you use them to find the storage path.

5.  **Authentication**:
    *   `deltalake` uses environment variables like `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` for authentication when interacting with tables on Databricks (e.g., on DBFS or through Unity Catalog paths). The script already gathers these, which is good.

**Summary of Changes:**

*   Switch Python library from `pyspark` to `deltalake`.
*   Remove Spark-specific code.
*   Adapt the table writing logic to use `deltalake.write_deltalake()` with a Pandas DataFrame and a table path.
*   Adjust how the target Delta table is specified, likely using its storage path or a Unity Catalog path if `deltalake` is configured for it.

This approach would allow your script to run without a local Java installation.

Would you like me to proceed with refactoring the script to use the `deltalake` library? We would need to confirm how you want to specify the target Delta table (e.g., full DBFS path or if we should try to use the catalog.schema.table name with `deltalake`'s Unity Catalog support).

_**User**_

ok, this looks very good, refactor it to do this

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I will refactor the script `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` to use the `deltalake` Python library. This will remove the PySpark dependency and thus the need for a local Java installation.

Here's a summary of the planned changes:
1.  Update the script's dependencies in the header to replace `pyspark` with `deltalake`.
2.  Remove the `--cluster-id` command-line argument and its associated logic, as it's specific to PySpark's Databricks Connect.
3.  Remove all PySpark-specific code, including `SparkSession` initialization, DataFrame conversions to Spark DataFrames, and the Spark-based write method (`saveAsTable`).
4.  Import `write_deltalake` from the `deltalake` library.
5.  Implement the data writing logic using `write_deltalake(databricks_table_name, pandas_df, mode="append", storage_options=...)`.
6.  Pass Databricks host and token to `write_deltalake` via the `storage_options` parameter. The script already collects these.
7.  Update logging messages and warnings to reflect the use of `deltalake`.

I will now apply these changes to the `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` file.

The script `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` has been refactored.

Here's a summary of the key changes:
-   The `pyspark` dependency has been replaced with `deltalake>=0.17.0` in the script's `uv` header.
-   The `--cluster-id` argument and related logic have been removed.
-   All `SparkSession` related code has been removed.
-   The script now imports `write_deltalake` from the `deltalake` library.
-   When new records are found in SQLite, `write_deltalake()` is now used to append the Pandas DataFrame to the specified Databricks Delta table.
    -   It uses `mode="append"`.
    -   It passes `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` (if provided via arguments, environment variables, or config) in the `storage_options` parameter. I've added a check to prepend `https://` to the host if a scheme is missing.
    -   The `engine="rust"` is explicitly specified, although it's generally the default.
-   Logging messages have been updated to reflect these changes. For example, it no longer mentions SparkSession initialization and refers to `deltalake` for write operations.
-   The final `spark.stop()` call has been removed.

You should now be able to run this script without needing Java installed, provided the `deltalake` library and its dependencies are installed (which `uv run -s` should handle based on the updated header).

Please test this version of the script with your Databricks setup. You'll need to ensure that the `DATABRICKS_HOST` and `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` are correctly configured for `deltalake` to authenticate and access your Unity Catalog tables or DBFS paths. The table name provided via `--table` should be the fully qualified name (e.g., `your_catalog.your_schema.your_table`) which `deltalake` should be able to resolve when using Unity Catalog.

It seems like the `deltalake` library is encountering a column in your Pandas DataFrame that it infers as having a "Null" data type, which is not permissible for defining a Delta Lake table schema. This usually happens if a column contains only `None` or `NaN` values, and the underlying Arrow conversion (which `deltalake` uses) represents it as a pure NullType array. Delta Lake requires a more specific data type (like String, Integer, etc.) for each column in the schema.

To resolve this, we can explicitly convert columns that consist entirely of null values to a default data type, such as `str`, before writing the DataFrame. This will ensure that every column has a concrete type.

I'll add a loop to iterate through the columns of the `pandas_df` right before the `write_deltalake` call. If any column is found to contain only null values, its type will be converted to `str`.

I've added a code snippet to `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` that will iterate through the columns of your Pandas DataFrame (`pandas_df`) before it's written to Delta Lake. If a column is detected to have all null values, it will be cast to a string type (`str`), and a log message will indicate this.

This should prevent the `_internal.SchemaMismatchError: Invalid data type for Delta Lake: Null` error.

Please try running the script again.

It looks like the previous change fixed the "Null data type" error, and the data was successfully appended!

The new error `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'isoformat'` is happening because the `last_ts` variable, which is supposed to be a Pandas Timestamp object, is now a string. This occurs after this line:
`last_ts = pandas_df[actual_sqlite_timestamp_col].max()`

This can happen if the `actual_sqlite_timestamp_col` itself was converted to string type by the logic we added:
```python
                # Ensure columns with all nulls are cast to a specific type (e.g., string)
                # to avoid SchemaMismatchError: Invalid data type for Delta Lake: Null
                for col in pandas_df.columns:
                    if pandas_df[col].isnull().all():
                        logging.info(
                            f"Column '{col}' contains only null values. Casting to string type."
                        )
                        pandas_df[col] = pandas_df[col].astype(str)
```
If `actual_sqlite_timestamp_col` somehow ended up with all nulls in a particular batch (which is unlikely for a primary timestamp column but possible), it would have been converted to `str`. Then, `pandas_df[actual_sqlite_timestamp_col].max()` would return a string, not a timestamp.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `last_ts` is always a Pandas Timestamp object before we try to call `.isoformat()` on it. We can do this by explicitly converting it back to a datetime object using `pd.to_datetime()` right after getting the maximum value.

I will modify the line where `last_ts` is updated to ensure it's a timestamp.

```diff
  
                  # Update state timestamp
-                 last_ts = pandas_df[
+                 last_ts_val = pandas_df[
                      actual_sqlite_timestamp_col
                  ].max()  # Get max from pandas Series
+                 
+                 # Ensure last_ts is a pandas Timestamp before calling isoformat
+                 if not isinstance(last_ts_val, pd.Timestamp):
+                     last_ts = pd.to_datetime(last_ts_val, utc=True)
+                 else:
+                     last_ts = last_ts_val
+ 
                  if pd.isna(
                      last_ts
```

---

I've updated the section in `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` where `last_ts` is determined.
After getting the maximum value from the timestamp column, it now explicitly checks if the retrieved value is a Pandas Timestamp. If it's not (e.g., if it became a string), it converts it to a `pd.Timestamp` object (and sets it to UTC).

This should ensure that `last_ts.isoformat()` is always called on a proper Timestamp object, resolving the `AttributeError`.

You can try running the script again.

[DELTA_READ_TABLE_WITHOUT_COLUMNS] You are trying to read a Delta table `bacalhau_catalog`.`sensor_data`.`readings` that does not have any columns.

Write some new data with the option `mergeSchema = true` to be able to read the table.

The error `[DELTA_READ_TABLE_WITHOUT_COLUMNS] You are trying to read a Delta table ... that does not have any columns` indicates that the target Delta table (it seems to be `bacalhau_catalog.sensor_data.readings` according to your error, though the script was targeting `bacalhau_catalog.sensor_data.sensor_logs` -- please ensure the table name in your config matches the one you intend to write to) exists but has no schema defined.

The error message suggests using `mergeSchema = true`. In the `deltalake` Python library (version 0.17.0 as per your script's dependencies), the equivalent for `write_deltalake` when using `mode="append"` is to set the `overwrite_schema=True` parameter. This will allow the schema of the Pandas DataFrame being written to define or update the Delta table's schema.

I will modify the `write_deltalake` call in `databricks-uploader/sqlite_to_delta_uploader.py` to include `overwrite_schema=True`. This should allow the script to create the schema if the table is new/empty or update it if the DataFrame contains new columns.
