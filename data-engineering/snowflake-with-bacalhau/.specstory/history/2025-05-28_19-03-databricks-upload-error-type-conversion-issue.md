# Databricks Upload Error: Type Conversion Issue (2025-05-28 12:03:36)

_**User**_

what happened here? are we creating a file in memory and uploading it?

Okay, I can help you understand what happened and how to address the error.

**What happened?**

The error message `pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid: ("Could not convert '2025-05-27T00:52:42.426' with type str: tried to convert to double", 'Conversion failed for column timestamp with type object')` tells us that:
1.  The script was trying to write a pandas DataFrame to a Parquet file (`df.to_parquet(...)`).
2.  During this process, PyArrow (the library pandas uses under the hood for Parquet) encountered a column named `timestamp`.
3.  This `timestamp` column in your DataFrame has an `object` datatype, which in pandas usually means it contains Python strings (like '2025-05-27T00:52:42.426').
4.  PyArrow attempted to convert these string values into a `double` (a numeric type) for storage in the Parquet file, but it couldn't because the string '2025-05-27T00:52:42.426' is not a direct representation of a number; it's a date-time string.

Essentially, there's a mismatch between the data type of your timestamp column in the DataFrame (strings) and what PyArrow expects or tries to infer for Parquet conversion (in this case, it tried `double` and failed).

**Are we creating a file in memory and uploading it?**

Yes, your understanding is correct. The script does the following:
1.  `parquet_buffer = io.BytesIO()`: This creates an in-memory binary buffer (like a temporary file residing in RAM).
2.  `df.to_parquet(parquet_buffer, index=False)`: This converts the pandas DataFrame `df` into the Parquet format and writes it into that in-memory `parquet_buffer`.
3.  `w_sdk.dbfs.upload(uploaded_file_path_on_volume, parquet_buffer, overwrite=True)`: This then takes the content of that in-memory buffer and uploads it to the specified Databricks Volume path.

**How to fix this:**

The primary issue is that the `timestamp_field` column in your DataFrame needs to be converted to actual datetime objects before attempting to save it to Parquet. Pandas and PyArrow can then handle the conversion to an appropriate Parquet timestamp type.

Additionally, the logic for updating `last_ts` needs to be adjusted to work correctly with this datetime column.

I'll propose an edit that does two things:
1.  Converts the `timestamp_field` column in the DataFrame to pandas datetime objects (timezone-aware, UTC) right after the data is read from SQLite.
2.  Updates the logic for determining the `last_ts` to correctly use this new datetime column.

Here's the proposed change:
I will modify the script to convert the timestamp column to datetime objects after reading it from SQLite and adjust the logic for updating the last timestamp accordingly.

The code has been modified to address the timestamp conversion issue.

Here's a summary of the changes:
1.  **Timestamp Column Conversion**: Right after reading data from SQLite and before any processing or Parquet conversion, the script now attempts to convert the `timestamp_field` column into timezone-aware (UTC) pandas datetime objects using `pd.to_datetime()`. This ensures that PyArrow receives a proper datetime type instead of strings.
    *   If this conversion fails, it logs a detailed error and raises a `RuntimeError` to stop processing the current batch, as a correct timestamp is critical.
2.  **Updated `last_ts` Logic**:
    *   The logic for updating `last_ts` now directly uses the `.max()` of this datetime column.
    *   It checks if the `max_timestamp_in_batch` is indeed a valid timestamp (not NaT - "Not a Time") and if it's newer than the current `last_ts` before updating.
    *   The logging messages around this update have been made more specific.
3.  **SQLite Query with Epoch**: When querying SQLite for remaining records or new records, it continues to use `last_ts.timestamp()` which provides a Unix epoch float. This is generally compatible with how SQLite might store timestamps if they are numeric. If your SQLite timestamps are actually ISO8601 strings, the query `WHERE {timestamp_field} > ?` would still work as expected with string comparison, but having `last_ts` as a `pd.Timestamp` object is more robust for all other operations.

These changes should prevent the `pyarrow.lib.ArrowInvalid` error by ensuring the `timestamp` column has the correct data type before Parquet serialization. It also makes the `last_ts` handling more robust.

Please try running the script again. If you encounter further issues or if the SQLite timestamp column is stored in a very different format, we might need to adjust the `pd.to_datetime()` call or the SQLite query.
