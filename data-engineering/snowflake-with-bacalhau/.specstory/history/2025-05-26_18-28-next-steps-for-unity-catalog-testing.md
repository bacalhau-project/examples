Okay, now that the Unity Catalog is set up, the next logical step to test things out would be to create the target Delta Lake table in your Databricks workspace. This is where the uploader will send the data.

According to the `README.md`, you can do this by:

1.  Accessing your Databricks workspace SQL Editor. The URL will look something like: `https://<your-databricks-workspace-url>/sql/editor`
2.  Executing the following SQL query in the editor:

    ```sql
    -- Create managed table
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS bacalhau_catalog.sensor_data.readings
    USING DELTA
    TBLPROPERTIES (
      'delta.enableChangeDataFeed' = 'true',
      'delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite' = 'true'
    );
    ```

After creating the table, you can proceed to build and run the uploader to see data flowing into this table.

Would you like me to guide you through building the uploader container next, or would you prefer to do something else?
