# Correct Directory for Latest Tag (2025-05-16 09:48:47)

_**User**_

the "latest-tag" should be in this directory, not in the project root.

Okay, I understand you want the file that stores the latest tag to be located in the script's directory (`cosmos-uploader/`) rather than in the project root.

Currently, the script writes the tag to two files:
1. `$PROJECT_ROOT/.latest-image-tag`
2. `$SCRIPT_DIR/latest-tag`

I will remove the line that creates the tag file in the project root (`$PROJECT_ROOT/.latest-image-tag`), leaving only the one in the script directory (`$SCRIPT_DIR/latest-tag`).

I'll apply this change to `cosmos-uploader/build.sh`.

---

```diff
  
      # Write the tag to a file for other scripts to use
-     echo "$TAG" > "$PROJECT_ROOT/.latest-image-tag"
      echo "$TAG" > "$SCRIPT_DIR/latest-tag"
      if [ "$PUSH_TO_REGISTRY" = true ]; then
```

---

The change has been applied. The script will now only write the `latest-tag` file to the `cosmos-uploader` directory and no longer create `.latest-image-tag` in the project root.
