   - Note down connection string, key, and endpoint information
   
   **Validation**: Successfully access the Cosmos DB account through Azure Portal

2. **Install Required Dependencies**
   - Update `requirements.txt` to include Azure Cosmos DB SDK
   ```
   azure-cosmos>=4.5.0
   ```
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   **Validation**: Successfully install all dependencies without errors

3. **Create Basic Connection Module**
   - Create a new file `cosmos-uploader/cosmos_connection.py` with basic connection functionality
   - Implement connection pooling and singleton pattern for the Cosmos DB client

   **Validation**: Successfully connect to Cosmos DB and perform a simple operation (e.g., create a test document)

4. **Update Configuration Format**
   - Create a new configuration template `config.cosmos.example.yaml` that includes Cosmos DB specific settings
   - Include settings for endpoint, key, database name, container name, and partition key
   
   **Validation**: Successfully load and parse the configuration file

## Phase 2: Basic Data Operations

   **Validation**: Achieve at least 1000 inserts per second on local machine

3. **Create Visualization Dashboard**
   - Implement a simple dashboard using matplotlib or similar
   - Display real-time metrics:
     - Insertion rate
     - RU consumption
     - Error rates
     - Network bandwidth usage
   
   **Validation**: Dashboard correctly displays all metrics during a test run

4. **Implement Comparison Tool**
   - Create a tool to compare PostgreSQL vs Cosmos DB performance
   - Measure and report on:
     - Insertion throughput
     - Query performance
     - Resource utilization
   
   **Validation**: Generate a comprehensive comparison report

## Phase 4: Containerization and Remote Testing

### Goal
Containerize the Cosmos DB uploader and prepare for distributed testing across multiple nodes.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Update Dockerfile**
   - Modify the existing Dockerfile to include Cosmos DB dependencies
   - Optimize container size and startup time
   
   **Validation**: Successfully build and run the container locally

2. **Create Cosmos DB Export Job YAML**
   - Create `cosmos_export_job.yaml` based on the existing `postgres_export_job.yaml`
   - Update environment variables and configuration for Cosmos DB
   
   **Validation**: Successfully deploy the job to a test environment

3. **Implement Distributed Testing**
   - Create scripts to deploy and test across multiple nodes
   - Implement aggregation of metrics from all nodes
   
   **Validation**: Successfully run a distributed test across at least 3 nodes

4. **Optimize Bulk Upload Performance**

     - Batching
     - Parallel processing
     - Retry with backoff
   - Tune parameters for optimal performance
   
   **Validation**: Achieve at least 5000 inserts per second across distributed nodes
