# --- Data Processing Configuration (Optional) ---
processing:
  # List of processors to apply sequentially.
  # Available processors (case-insensitive): Schematize, Sanitize
  # If this list is empty or omitted, raw data is used (after initial conversion).
  processors:
    - Schematize
    # - Sanitize # Uncomment to add sanitization (depends on Schematize)

  # Optional aggregation step, runs *after* the processors list.
  # If this section is present, 'window' is required.
  # aggregation:
  #   window: "5m" # Aggregation time window (e.g., 30s, 5m, 1h)

# Example 1: No processing pipeline, no aggregation (raw data)
# processing: {}
# or omit the 'processing' section entirely

# Example 2: Schematize and Sanitize pipeline, no aggregation
# processing:
#  processors:
#    - Schematize
#    - Sanitize

# Example 3: Schematize pipeline followed by 10-minute aggregation
# processing:
#   processors:
#     - Schematize
#   aggregation:
#     window: "10m"

# Example 4: Aggregation only (no pipeline processors)
# processing:
#   processors: [] # Empty list or omit
#   aggregation:
#     window: "1h"

# --- Configuration File Watching (Optional) ---
# This section is optional. If omitted, watching is enabled by default.

  poll_interval_seconds: 5 # Default: 5. How often to check for changes.
