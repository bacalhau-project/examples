# Cosmos with Bacalhau - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This project connects IoT sensor simulation with Azure Cosmos DB using Bacalhau for distributed data processing.

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Complete)
- [x] Set up Azure Cosmos DB account and database
- [x] Create containers with proper partition keys
- [x] Configure Azure role-based access control (RBAC)
- [x] Test basic connectivity from development environment

## Phase 2: Sensor Simulation (Complete)
- [x] Develop sensor simulation containers
- [x] Implement SQLite local storage
- [x] Create Docker images and push to registry
- [x] Set up Docker Compose for multi-city deployment

## Phase 3: Uploader Application (In Progress)
- [x] Develop .NET Core uploader application
- [x] Add configuration system for connection settings
- [x] Implement batch uploads with optimized performance
- [x] Create Docker container with proper entrypoint
- [x] Add error handling and retry logic
- [x] Set up continuous upload mode with interval settings
- [x] Add archive functionality for processed data

## Phase 4: Distributed Processing with Bacalhau (Next)
- [ ] Develop Bacalhau job specifications
- [ ] Set up workflow for distributed data processing
- [ ] Implement data transformation using WASM modules
- [ ] Create data visualization components
- [ ] Add anomaly detection algorithms

## Phase 5: Monitoring and Management (Future)
- [ ] Develop unified management scripts
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Implement cost optimization strategies
- [ ] Set up alerts and notifications
- [ ] Add automated scaling based on workload

## Current Tasks
1. Fix Docker entrypoint for uploader container
2. Test multi-city deployment with a full set of sensors
3. Verify data flow from sensors to Cosmos DB
4. Document setup and operation procedures

## Known Issues
1. ~~Conflict between docker-compose entrypoint and Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT~~ (Fixed)
2. Need to ensure proper environment variable passing to containers
3. Need to finalize Bacalhau job specifications for data processing
