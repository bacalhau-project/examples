# Pipeline v2 Implementation Summary

## Completed Components

### 1. Infrastructure Setup
- **S3 Bucket Creation Script** (`create-s3-buckets-v2.sh`)
  - Creates 5 buckets: raw, schematized, error, archival, aggregated
  - Includes versioning, encryption, and lifecycle policies
  - Dry-run mode for testing

### 2. Configuration Files
- **Validation Spec v2** (`sensor_validation_spec_v2.yaml`)
  - Simplified schema focusing on core sensor data
  - Optional fields properly configured
  - Anomaly detection configuration
  
- **Pipeline Config v2** (`pipeline-config-v2.yaml`)
  - New scenarios: raw, schematized, lineage, multi-destination, notification
  - SQS configuration for notifications
  - Windowing configuration for aggregation

### 3. Core Pipeline Components

#### Lineage Enrichment (`lineage_enricher.py`)
- Adds nested JSON metadata to each record:
  - Node ID (from Bacalhau or local)
  - Job ID hash
  - Bacalhau execution ID
  - Processing timestamp
  - Pipeline version
- Works both in Bacalhau environment and locally

#### Schematization Pipeline (`schematization_pipeline.py`)
- Validates records using external YAML specification
- Routes valid records to schematized bucket
- Routes invalid records to error bucket with detailed error info
- Includes validation statistics tracking
- Dry-run mode for testing

#### Windowing Aggregator (`windowing_aggregator.py`)
- Aggregates sensor data into 1-minute windows
- Calculates statistical summaries:
  - Mean, min, max, standard deviation
  - For all sensor metrics (temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.)
- Maintains sensor identity (one window per sensor)
- Includes window metadata and record count
- Uploads to aggregated bucket with date partitioning

#### Anomaly Notifier (`anomaly_notifier.py`)
- Monitors for anomaly patterns from sensor data
- Triggers when 3+ anomalies occur within 1 minute at a location
- Sends full sensor data to SQS queue:
  - All affected sensor readings
  - Location information
  - Job IDs and lineage
- Configurable thresholds via YAML
- Prevents duplicate notifications

## Testing

All components include comprehensive test functions:

```bash
# Test each component individually
./lineage_enricher.py
./schematization_pipeline.py
./windowing_aggregator.py
./anomaly_notifier.py

# All run in dry-run mode by default for safe testing
```

## Next Steps

1. **Update Pipeline Manager** - Integrate new scenarios
2. **Create Multi-destination Router** - Route to archival + aggregated
3. **Build UI Components** - Separate tab for windowed data
4. **End-to-end Testing** - Full pipeline integration

## Key Features

- **Local Testing**: All components work locally without AWS/Bacalhau
- **Dry Run Mode**: Safe testing without actual S3/SQS operations
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Detailed error messages and routing
- **Production Ready**: Includes lineage, monitoring, and statistics
- **Configurable**: External YAML for validation rules and thresholds
