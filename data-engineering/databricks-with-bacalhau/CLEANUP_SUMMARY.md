# Pipeline Cleanup Summary

## ✅ Testing Checklist

### Code Quality
- [x] Python syntax validation passed
- [x] Ruff linter run and auto-fixes applied
- [x] Pipeline manager tested and working
- [x] Bucket configuration verified as consistent

### Changes Made
- [x] Removed "emergency" pipeline type from all code
- [x] Removed "regional" bucket references
- [x] Updated architecture documentation
- [x] Created cleanup scripts for S3 and IAM
- [x] Updated IAM policy JSON file

## 📋 Final Testing Steps

1. **Test the pipeline locally** (if sensor is running):
   ```bash
   ./run.sh databricks-uploader
   ```

2. **Verify pipeline types work**:
   ```bash
   uv run -s pipeline-manager/pipeline_controller.py \
     --db databricks-uploader/state/pipeline_config.db get
   ```

3. **Check S3 buckets** (when AWS credentials available):
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cleanup-old-buckets.sh --dry-run
   ```

## 🚀 Ready to Commit

The changes are ready to commit. Here's what was modified:

### Core Pipeline Changes
- Simplified from 5+ bucket types to 4 pipeline stages
- Removed emergency classification, integrated into aggregated stage
- Removed regional bucket concept entirely

### Files Modified (11 files, -77 lines net reduction)
- `databricks-uploader/`: Core pipeline logic updated
- `pipeline-manager/`: Removed emergency/regional enums
- `docs/`: Architecture diagrams simplified
- `scripts/`: Updated bucket references
- Shell scripts: Updated help text

### New Cleanup Tools
- `scripts/cleanup-old-buckets.sh` - Remove old S3 buckets
- `scripts/check-databricks-external-locations.py` - Check Unity Catalog
- `scripts/check-iam-policies.sh` - Update IAM policies

## 📝 Suggested Commit Message

```
refactor: simplify pipeline to 4-stage architecture

- Remove emergency and regional bucket concepts
- Consolidate to 4 stages: ingestion, validated, enriched, aggregated
- Update all code paths and documentation
- Add cleanup scripts for S3, IAM, and Databricks
- Reduce codebase by 77 lines while improving clarity

The emergency detection is now handled within the aggregated stage,
and regional separation can be achieved through partitioning rather
than separate buckets. This simplifies AWS IAM configuration and
Databricks external location setup.
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Commit the changes
2. Run cleanup scripts when AWS credentials are available
3. Update any Databricks notebooks if needed
4. Test end-to-end pipeline flow
