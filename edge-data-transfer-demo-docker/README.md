# 🛰️ Bacalhau Edge Sensor Demo

This project simulates a distributed edge network of sensor nodes powered by [Bacalhau](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau). Each sensor node acts as a compute node, and periodically sends sensor data to a central storage layer (MinIO). A frontend application displays this data in real-time on an interactive map.

All components are orchestrated using **Docker Compose**, and support multi-architecture builds (AMD64 and ARM64).

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed
2. A machine with available ports listed below

---

## ⚙️ Setup


### 1. (Optional) Configure the Frontend

If needed, adjust the environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `BACALHAU_API_HOST`).
Default is `orchestrator`

### 2. Sensor Behavior

Each sensor runs a custom script from `/scripts/*.sh;` make sure each file has execute permission set using `chmod +x`.


### 3. Start All Services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the following services:

- **MinIO** – S3-compatible object storage
- **Bacalhau Orchestrator** – Central control node
- **5 Sensor Nodes** – Simulated compute nodes running Bacalhau jobs
- **Frontend Dashboard** – Accessible via `http://localhost:3000`
- **Client Container** – Used to launch Bacalhau jobs manually

### 📦 Port Requirements

Ensure the following ports are available:

| Port | Description            |
|------|------------------------|
| 3000 | Frontend Dashboard     |
| 8438 | Bacalhau Web Interface |
| 9001 | MinIO Console          |

Also, the subnet `172.29.0.0/16` must be free for Docker networking.

---

## 🚀 Using the Demo

### 1. Open the Frontend

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the dashboard.

### 2. Access the Client Container

```bash
docker exec -ti edge-demo-client /bin/bash
```

From here, you can manually run jobs, transfer data, or debug sensors.

First what you need is generate random data 
```bash
cd /jobs
```
```bash
bacalhau job run generate.yaml
```
Run the data generation job (this may take 5–15 minutes, depending on your machine):
```bash
bacalhau job run create_metadata.yaml
```
Once the data is generated, run the metadata creation job

---

## 🧹 Cleaning Up the Environment

To stop all services and **remove all containers, networks, and volumes**:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

This will:

- Stop all running containers
- Remove networks and volumes (MinIO storage will be wiped)
- Reset the demo environment completely

> ⚠️ Warning: This will erase all stored sensor data

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- Check logs of a specific container:

```bash
docker logs -f <container-name>
```

- Restart everything with live logs:

```bash
docker compose up
```

- Remove unused Docker networks:

```bash
docker network prune
```

- Remove stopped containers:

```bash
docker container prune
```

- If the frontend fails to start on ARM devices, ensure the container is built for `linux/arm64`.

---

## ✏️ Development Notes

- Scripts in `./scripts` and jobs in `./jobs` are mounted into each sensor container.
- You can edit them live and restart containers to test changes.
- The `start.sh` script must be marked executable (`chmod +x`).
- You must run on `LOCALHOST`
