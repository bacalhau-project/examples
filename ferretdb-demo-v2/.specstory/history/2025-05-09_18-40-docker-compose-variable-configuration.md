# Docker Compose Variable Configuration (2025-05-09 11:40:26)

_**User**_

is it possible to set the "expansouser" "safepassword" at the top of a docker compose file, and use it throughout the file, instead of hardcoding?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, that's a good practice! You can define those values in the `x-common-env-variables` section at the top of your `docker-compose.yml` file and then reference them in the respective services.

I'll add `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to `x-common-env-variables` and update the `postgres` and `ferretdb` services to use these new variables.

```diff
    FERRETDB_URI: "mongodb://expansouser:safepassword@ferretdb:27017/postgres"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:-set-your-own-google-maps-api-key}
+   POSTGRES_USER: "expansouser"
+   POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "safepassword"
  
  x-sensor-template: &sensor-template
        - 5432:5432
      environment:
-       - POSTGRES_USER=expansouser
-       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=safepassword
+       - POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER}
+       - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
        - POSTGRES_DB=postgres
      networks:
        - 27217:27017
      environment:
-       - FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://expansouser:safepassword@postgres:5432/postgres
+       - FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL=postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/postgres
      healthcheck:
        test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8088/debug/livez"]
```

---

I've updated the `docker-compose.yml` file. Now, `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` are defined in the `x-common-env-variables` section and referenced in the `postgres` and `ferretdb` services. This makes it easier to manage these credentials.

There's one more place where these credentials are used: the `FERRETDB_URI` in `x-common-env-variables`. I'll update that as well to use the new variables.

```diff
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "minioadmin"
    BACALHAU_DISABLEANALYTICS: true
-   FERRETDB_URI: "mongodb://expansouser:safepassword@ferretdb:27017/postgres"
+   FERRETDB_URI: "mongodb://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@ferretdb:27017/postgres"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:-set-your-own-google-maps-api-key}
    POSTGRES_USER: "expansouser"
```

---

Alright, I've updated `FERRETDB_URI` as well. Now all instances of "expansouser" and "safepassword" are using the variables defined at the top of the file.

You're right, that didn't work as expected. The `${VARIABLE}` syntax in Docker Compose files is used for substituting values from your shell's environment or from a `.env` file. It doesn't directly use values defined elsewhere in the same `docker-compose.yml` file for constructing strings like URIs.

The warnings `The "POSTGRES_USER" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.` indicate that Docker Compose is looking for `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` in your environment, not within the YAML structure itself for those specific interpolations.

To fix this, we need to revert the parts where we tried to use `${POSTGRES_USER}` and `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` for constructing the `FERRETDB_URI`, the `postgres` service's credentials, and `ferretdb`'s connection URL. These will need to use the literal values "expansouser" and "safepassword".

The `POSTGRES_USER: "expansouser"` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "safepassword"` definitions that you added to the `x-common-env-variables` block are still useful if other services need these exact environment variables set when they use the `*common-env-variables` anchor. However, for building the connection strings, we have to use the explicit values.

I'll make the following changes:
1.  Update `FERRETDB_URI` in `x-common-env-variables` to use the literal credentials.
2.  Update the `environment` section of the `postgres` service to use literal credentials.
3.  Update the `FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL` in the `ferretdb` service's environment to use literal credentials.

This will mean "expansouser" and "safepassword" are written explicitly in a few places, but it will resolve the warnings and ensure the services are configured correctly. If you want a single point of definition that's reused everywhere, including within string constructions, the standard Docker Compose method is to use a `.env` file.

Let's apply the fix.

```

OK, I've made those changes. The `FERRETDB_URI`, `postgres` service environment, and `ferretdb` service environment now use the literal "expansouser" and "safepassword" values. This should resolve the warnings and allow the services to start correctly.

Please try running `docker compose up --scale sensors=5` again.

_**User**_

don't make any chancges - just answer the following:

is it possible to set global values at the top of a docker compose file?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

You're asking a great question about how to manage configurations in Docker Compose.

Yes, it's possible to define values in a way that they can be reused, which is often what people mean by "global values" in this context. There are a couple of primary mechanisms:

1.  **YAML Anchors and Aliases (e.g., `x-common-env-variables`)**:
    *   This is what we've been using in your `docker-compose.yml` file. You define a block of YAML (like a set of environment variables) with an anchor (`&anchor_name`) and then reuse it elsewhere with an alias (`*anchor_name`).
    *   **Purpose**: This is excellent for Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principles within the YAML structure itself. It helps keep common configurations consistent.
    *   **Limitation**: As we discovered, these YAML-defined anchors are primarily for structuring the YAML. They are not directly substitutable into string interpolations (like `mongodb://${USER}:${PASSWORD}@...`) within the same file *if the intention is to use the YAML anchor's value for that interpolation*. Docker Compose's `${VARIABLE}` syntax looks for variables in the environment (shell or `.env` file).

2.  **.env File**:
    *   You can create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.
    *   Inside this `.env` file, you can define variables like:
        ```env
        POSTGRES_USER=expansouser
        POSTGRES_PASSWORD=safepassword
        ```
    *   **Purpose**: Docker Compose automatically loads this `.env` file. Then, throughout your `docker-compose.yml`, you can use the `${POSTGRES_USER}` or `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` syntax, and Docker Compose will substitute the values from the `.env` file. This is the standard way to have truly global, substitutable variables for your Compose project.
    *   **Benefit**: This keeps sensitive data or environment-specific configurations out of your main `docker-compose.yml`, making it more portable and secure.

3.  **Shell Environment Variables**:
    *   You can also set environment variables directly in your shell before running `docker-compose up`. For example:
        ```bash
        export POSTGRES_USER=expansouser
        export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=safepassword
        docker-compose up
        ```
    *   Docker Compose will pick these up for substitution just like variables from a `.env` file. `.env` file variables typically take precedence over shell environment variables if there's a name conflict.

**In summary:**

*   For **reusing blocks of YAML configuration** (like common environment variables for multiple services), **YAML anchors (`&` and `*`)** are the way to go. This is what `x-common-env-variables` is doing.
*   For **values that need to be substituted into strings** (like connection URIs or dynamic port numbers) throughout your `docker-compose.yml` using the `${VARIABLE}` syntax, the **`.env` file** or **shell environment variables** are the standard approach.

The issue we encountered earlier was trying to use a YAML anchor's value *as if* it were an environment variable for the `${...}` substitution *within the same YAML file's string construction*. Docker Compose's `${...}` substitution mechanism primarily looks outside the `docker-compose.yml` (to `.env` or the shell) for those values.

So, while you can define the *environment variables themselves* using an anchor (like `POSTGRES_USER: "expansouser"` inside `x-common-env-variables`), when you construct a string like `FERRETDB_URI: "mongodb://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@..."`, the `${POSTGRES_USER}` part expects `POSTGRES_USER` to be an actual environment variable (from `.env` or shell), not just a key in a YAML anchor.

---

_**User**_

can we enforce that environment variables must be set before moving forward?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Yes, you can enforce that environment variables must be set before Docker Compose proceeds. If a required variable is missing (or empty, depending on the syntax used), Docker Compose will display an error message and refuse to start the services.

This is done using a specific syntax when you reference the variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

1.  **`${VARIABLE:?error message}`**:
    *   If `VARIABLE` is **unset or empty**, Docker Compose will fail and print the custom "error message".
    *   This is generally the recommended form for mandatory variables.

2.  **`${VARIABLE?error message}`**:
    *   If `VARIABLE` is **unset**, Docker Compose will fail and print the custom "error message".
    *   Note: This form might allow an empty string if the variable is set but empty (e.g., `MY_VAR=""`). The `VAR:?err` form is stricter as it also checks for empty.

3.  **`${VARIABLE:?}`** or **`${VARIABLE?}`**:
    *   If you omit the custom error message, Docker Compose will use a generic error message indicating the variable is required.

**How it applies to your current `docker-compose.yml`:**

The most relevant variable in your current setup for this kind of enforcement is `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, which is used to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`.
Currently, it's defined with a default value if not set:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:-set-your-own-google-maps-api-key}`

If you wanted to make `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` mandatory, you would change that line in the `x-common-env-variables` section to something like:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:?GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY must be set in your environment or .env file.}`

If you then tried to run `docker-compose up` without `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` being defined in your shell environment or in a `.env` file, Docker Compose would stop and show your error message.

**For variables like `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`:**

In your current setup, these are:
*   Hardcoded in connection strings (e.g., in `FERRETDB_URI` and `FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL`).
*   Defined with specific values within the `x-common-env-variables` anchor and for the `postgres` service.

If you wanted to make these mandatory *from the external environment* (i.e., force them to be set in a `.env` file or the shell), you would need to:
1.  Modify the places where they are used (like the connection strings and the `postgres` service's environment) to use the `${VARIABLE:?error}` syntax. For example:
    `FERRETDB_POSTGRESQL_URL: "postgres://${POSTGRES_USER:?POSTGRES_USER is required}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:?POSTGRES_PASSWORD is required}@postgres:5432/postgres"`
2.  You would then typically remove their hardcoded definitions from `x-common-env-variables` or the service definitions if you *only* want them to come from the external environment.

So, the mechanism is there for variables that Docker Compose expects to substitute from the environment. It allows you to make your Compose setup more robust by ensuring all necessary configurations are provided before attempting to start your application.

_**User**_

ok, sounds great - please add this immediatley to the docker-compose.yaml

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I will update the `docker-compose.yml` file to make the `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` a mandatory environment variable. If it's not set when you run `docker-compose up`, the process will stop and display an error message.

I'll modify the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` line in the `x-common-env-variables` section.

```diff
    BACALHAU_DISABLEANALYTICS: true
    FERRETDB_URI: "mongodb://expansouser:safepassword@ferretdb:27017/postgres"
-   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:-set-your-own-google-maps-api-key}
+   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: ${GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY:?GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY must be set. Please provide it in your .env file or shell environment.}
    POSTGRES_USER: "expansouser"
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "safepassword"
```

---

I've updated the `docker-compose.yml` file. Now, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is a required environment variable. If you try to run `docker-compose up` without it being set (either in your shell or in a `.env` file), Docker Compose will stop and display the message: "GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY must be set. Please provide it in your .env file or shell environment."
