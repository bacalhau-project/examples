The error message `Error: Error response from daemon: Get "https://registry-proxy:5000/v2/": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client` indicates that your system is trying to connect to a Docker registry (or a proxy for it) using HTTPS, but the registry is responding with HTTP. This mismatch in protocols (HTTPS vs. HTTP) is causing the connection to fail.

This often occurs when a Docker client or a similar tool attempts to pull an image from a Docker registry, and there's a misconfiguration in how the registry is set up or accessed.

I'll perform a web search to find common causes and solutions for this issue.

The web search results confirm that this error is common when Docker (or a similar client) expects to communicate with a registry over HTTPS, but the registry is configured to use HTTP. The `registry-proxy:5000` in your error message is the address of the registry your system is trying to reach.

Here are the common causes and solutions:

1.  **Insecure Registry Configuration**:
    *   If `registry-proxy:5000` is a private Docker registry that you control and it's intentionally set up to use HTTP, you need to configure your Docker daemon to treat this registry as an "insecure registry."
    *   This usually involves editing the Docker daemon configuration file (e.g., `/etc/docker/daemon.json` on Linux or `C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json` on Windows) and adding an entry like:
        ```json
        {
          "insecure-registries" : ["registry-proxy:5000"]
        }
        ```
        (Note: Some sources suggest including `http://` in the address, like `http://registry-proxy:5000`. You might need to experiment to see what works for your setup.)
    *   After editing this file, you must restart the Docker daemon for the changes to take effect.

2.  **Incorrect Registry URL**:
    *   Ensure that the URL being used to access the registry is correct. If the registry is indeed HTTP-only, clients trying to access it should use `http://registry-proxy:5000` and not `https://registry-proxy:5000`. The error message shows that the client is attempting an HTTPS connection.

3.  **Proxy Configuration**:
    *   If there's a proxy server between your machine and the `registry-proxy:5000`, it might be misconfigured and causing this protocol mismatch. Check any relevant HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings on your system or within your Docker configuration.

4.  **BuildKit Configuration (Less Common for this specific error but related to registry access)**:
    *   Docker's BuildKit build system can sometimes have different behavior with registries. If you're encountering this during a `docker build` process, and you've configured insecure registries, you might also need to ensure BuildKit respects this (e.g., by setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` as an environment variable temporarily, or configuring BuildKit appropriately). However, your error seems to be more about a direct pull/scan rather than a build.

5.  **Docker Desktop Specific Issues**:
    *   If you are using Docker Desktop, sometimes resetting it to factory defaults or cleaning/purging data can resolve persistent networking or configuration issues. This should be a last resort.

**To help pinpoint the issue, could you tell me more about your setup?**

*   Is `registry-proxy:5000` a public registry, a private registry you manage, or something set up by your organization?
*   Are you running Docker commands directly, or is this error coming from another tool that uses Docker (like Bacalhau, based on the script you attached)?
*   What operating system are you on?

The script `1_run_generate_sensor_logs_job.sh` uses `bacalhau job run` with a YAML file. It's likely that the job defined in `/jobs/generate_sensor_logs_job.yaml` tries to pull a Docker image, and that's where the error originates. If you can share the contents of that YAML file, it might provide more clues, specifically the image name it's trying to use.

i want all the nodes in this cluster to be able to talk to the registry-proxy over port 5000, but that conflicts with the public 5000 i have on my machine. How do i do this? is there a way to open port 5000 between all the nodes just inside of ferret-demo-net

You're on the right track with wanting to isolate the communication to the `ferret-demo-net` network to avoid conflicts with your host machine's port `5000`. Here's how Docker networking and your `docker-compose.yml` setup facilitate this, and how to address the underlying HTTP/HTTPS error:

**Inter-container Communication on `ferret-demo-net`**

1.  **Internal Accessibility**: Services within the same Docker network (like `ferret-demo-net`) can reach each other using their service name as the hostname and the port the service *inside the container* is listening on.
    *   Your `registry-proxy` service is named `registry-proxy`.
    *   The `registry:2` image it uses listens on port `5000` by default inside its container.
    *   Therefore, other services in `ferret-demo-net` (like `orchestrator`, `sensors`, `client`, etc.) can already connect to your registry at the address `registry-proxy:5000`.

2.  **Host Port Mapping (`ports: - "5001:5000"`)**:
    *   The `ports: - "5001:5000"` line in your `registry-proxy` service definition means: "Map port `5001` on the *host machine* to port `5000` inside the `registry-proxy` container."
    *   This is how you would access the registry from your host machine (e.g., `localhost:5001`). This setup correctly avoids using port `5000` on your host.
    *   If you *only* need the registry to be accessible by other containers within the `ferret-demo-net` and not from your host, you could theoretically remove this `ports` mapping entirely. However, keeping it as `5001:5000` is fine and doesn't cause the internal conflict.

**Addressing the "http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client" Error**

The core issue for the error you initially saw is not that the nodes can't reach `registry-proxy:5000`, but that they are trying to speak HTTPS to an HTTP service. The `registry:2` image, by default, serves content over HTTP.

Your `orchestrator` and `sensors` services (via `x-sensor-template`) mount a Docker daemon configuration file:
`./docker-config/daemon.json:/etc/docker/daemon.json`

This `daemon.json` file needs to tell the Docker daemon *running inside those containers* that `registry-proxy:5000` is an insecure registry and that it's okay to communicate with it over HTTP.

I'll check the current content of `./docker-config/daemon.json`.


---

Read file: ./docker-config/daemon.json

---

The `daemon.json` file looks mostly correct for allowing HTTP communication with your local proxy:

```json
{
  "dns": [
    "1.1.1.1"
  ],
  "registry-mirrors": [
    "http://registry-proxy:5000"
  ],
  "insecure-registries": [
    "registry-proxy:5000"
  ],
  "mtu": 1450
}
```

The key line ` "insecure-registries": ["registry-proxy:5000"]` is present. This *should* instruct the Docker daemons within your `orchestrator` and `sensors` containers to allow HTTP connections to `registry-proxy:5000`.

Given this, the error `Get "https://registry-proxy:5000/v2/": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client` is a bit perplexing because the `insecure-registries` setting is designed to prevent Docker from attempting HTTPS for the specified registries.

Here are a few possibilities and
